# Google-Data-Analytics
Its been a wonderful journey throughout this course and learned very much. And this course introduced me to data, which is a heart of all businesses nowadays. And this is all I have learned And it also introduced me to SQL and Google Sheets.
## Data, data, data everywhere:

What do companies in e-commerce, entertainment, healthcare, manufacturing, marketing, finance, tech, and hundreds of other industries all have in common? You guessed it, they all use data. Organizations of all kinds need data analysts to help them improve their processes, identify opportunities and trends, launch new products, provide great customer service, and make thoughtful decisions, what exactly is data? Well, I'll like to say that data is a collection of facts. This collection can include numbers, pictures, videos, words, measurements, observations, and more. Once you have data, analytics puts it to work through analysis. Data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making. And it doesn't stop there. Data evolves over time which means this analysis or analytics, as we call it, can give us new information throughout data's entire life cycle. Data is everywhere. You use and create data everyday. Have you ever read reviews of a product before deciding whether or not to buy it? That's data analysis. Or maybe you wear a fitness tracker to count your steps so you can stay active throughout the day. That's data analysis. But you don't just use data. You also create huge amounts of it every single day. Any time you use your phone, look up something online, stream music, shop with a credit card, post on social media or use GPS to map a route, you're creating data. Our digital world and the millions of smart devices inside of it have made the amount of data available truly mind-blowing. Here at Google we process more than 40,000 searches every second. That's 3.5 billion searches a day and 1.2 trillion searches every year. Here's another way to think about it. YouTube has almost two billion users. If YouTube users made up a country, it would be the largest in the world. All of that data is transforming the world around us. The publication The Economist recently called data the world's most valuable resource. It's easy to see why data analysts are so valued by their organizations. What exactly does a data analyst do? Put simply, a data analyst is someone who collects, transforms, and organizes data in order to help make informed decisions. Besides the role itself, one of the most exciting parts of being a data analyst is the number of opportunities available.  The Google Data Analytics Certificate is split into courses based on different processes for data analysis. Those are ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.

Every day, the amount of data out there gets bigger and bigger. So the ability to interpret it effectively is more important than ever before. Data analytics is becoming one of the fastest-growing and most rewarding career choices in the world. In the next decade, the demand for business analytics skills will probably be higher than the demand for any other career (10.9% vs. 5.2%) (Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics). All kinds of companies all over the world need qualified data analysts to solve problems and help them make the best possible business decisions. And right now, fifty-nine percent of companies have plans to add even more positions requiring data analysis skills (Source: SHRM). By the time you are done with this program, you will be well-prepared to make smart, strategic, data-driven recommendations for organizations in all kinds of industries.

 At this point, you've been introduced to the world of data analytics and what data analysts do.  At Google, all of our products are built on data and data-driven decision making. From concept to development to launch, they're using data to figure out the best way forward. And they're not alone. Countless other organizations also see the incredible value in data and, of course, the data analysts who help them make use of it. So we know data opens up a lot of opportunities. But to help you wrap your head around all the ways you can actually use data, let's go over a few examples from everyday life. You might not realize it, but people analyze data all the time. For instance, I'm a morning person. A long time ago, I realized that I'm happier and more productive if I get to bed early and wake up early. I came to this conclusion after noticing a pattern in my day-to-day experiences. When I got seven hours of sleep and woke up at 6:30, I was the most successful. So I thought about the relationship between this pattern and my daily life, and I predicted that early to bed early to rise would be the right choice for me. And I'm definitely my best self when I wake up bright and early. I bet you've identified patterns and relationships in your life, too. Maybe about your own sleep cycle or how you feel after eating certain foods, or what time of day you like to workout. All of these are great examples of real life patterns and relationships that you can use to make predictions about the right actions to take, and that is a huge part of data analysis right there. Now, let's put this process into a business setting. You may remember from an earlier video that there's a ton of data out there. And every minute of every hour of every day, more data is being created. Businesses need a way to control all that data so they can use it to improve processes, identify opportunities and trends, launch new products, serve customers, and make thoughtful decisions. For businesses to be on top of the competition, they need to be on top of their data. That's why these companies hire data analysts to control the waves of data they collect every day, makes sense of it, and then draw conclusions or make predictions. This is the process of turning data into insights, and it's how analysts help businesses put all their data to good use. This is actually a good way to think about analysis: turning data into insights. As a reminder, the more detailed definition you learned earlier is that data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making. So after analysts have created insights from data, what happens? Well, a lot. Those insights are shared with others, decisions are made, and businesses take action. And here's where it can get really exciting. Data analytics can help organizations completely rethink something they do or point them in a totally new direction. For example, maybe data leads them to a new product or unique service, or maybe it helps them find a new way to deliver an incredible customer experience. It's these kinds of aha moments that can help businesses reach another level, and that makes data analysts vital to any business.

you can find data pretty much everywhere. Any time you observe and evaluate something in the world, you’re collecting and analyzing data. Your analysis helps you find easier ways of doing things, identify patterns to save you time, and discover surprising new perspectives that can completely change the way you experience things.

Here is a real-life example of how one group of data analysts used the six steps of the data analysis process to improve their workplace and its business processes. Their story involves something called people analytics — also known as human resources analytics or workforce analytics. People analytics is the practice of collecting and analyzing data on the people who make up a company’s workforce in order to gain insights to improve how the company operates.

Being a people analyst involves using data analysis to gain insights about employees and how they experience their work lives. The insights are used to define and create a more productive and empowering workplace. This can unlock employee potential, motivate people to perform at their best, and ensure a fair and inclusive company culture.

The six steps of the data analysis process that you have been learning in this program are: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share,** and **act**. These six steps apply to any data analysis. Continue reading to learn how a team of people analysts used these six steps to answer a business question.

An organization was experiencing a high turnover rate among new hires. Many employees left the company before the end of their first year on the job. The analysts used the data analysis process to answer the following question: **how can the organization improve the retention rate for new employees?**

Here is a break down of what this team did, step by step.

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Nxf_nX4JSJyX_51-CQic-A_9153cb6c7f9e4f6486ca5b392425e8f1_DA_C1M1L2R1_A.png?expiry=1680480000000&hmac=Obfyk6s0rdC2-vAQv-DU7NoJ6tKk_jMFZNPYpcUBpFY](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Nxf_nX4JSJyX_51-CQic-A_9153cb6c7f9e4f6486ca5b392425e8f1_DA_C1M1L2R1_A.png?expiry=1680480000000&hmac=Obfyk6s0rdC2-vAQv-DU7NoJ6tKk_jMFZNPYpcUBpFY)

First up, the analysts needed to define what the project would look like and what would qualify as a successful result. So, to determine these things, they **asked** effective questions and collaborated with leaders and managers who were interested in the outcome of their people analysis. These were the kinds of questions they asked:

- What do you think new employees need to learn to be successful in their first year on the job?
- Have you gathered data from new employees before? If so, may we have access to the historical data?
- Do you believe managers with higher retention rates offer new employees something extra or unique?
- What do you suspect is a leading cause of dissatisfaction among new employees?
- By what percentage would you like employee retention to increase in the next fiscal year?

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/YWrURSqZQWKq1EUqmXFiow_a86286a5a4f74e0eabf0e46e7e03836b_DA_C1M1L2R1_B.png?expiry=1680480000000&hmac=Q8lEmCSBQ43nUGuJJyQQueHjmJjR8HPUEUU7FUTWQmg](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/YWrURSqZQWKq1EUqmXFiow_a86286a5a4f74e0eabf0e46e7e03836b_DA_C1M1L2R1_B.png?expiry=1680480000000&hmac=Q8lEmCSBQ43nUGuJJyQQueHjmJjR8HPUEUU7FUTWQmg)

It all started with solid **preparation**. The group built a timeline of three months and decided how they wanted to relay their progress to interested parties. Also during this step, the analysts identified what data they needed to achieve the successful result they identified in the previous step - in this case, the analysts chose to gather the data from an online survey of new employees. These were the things they did to prepare:

- They developed specific questions to ask about employee satisfaction with different business processes, such as hiring and onboarding, and their overall compensation.
- They established rules for who would have access to the data collected - in this case, anyone outside the group wouldn't have access to the raw data, but could view summarized or aggregated data. For example, an individual's compensation wouldn't be available, but salary ranges for groups of individuals would be viewable.
- They finalized what specific information would be gathered, and how best to present the data visually. The analysts brainstormed possible project- and data-related issues and how to avoid them.

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/nvjkJ-_DQym45CfvwwMpZg_ca752b42a2494e299da71b7025254106_DA_C1M1L2R1_C.png?expiry=1680480000000&hmac=DcCBLQkRhje2oxSbtRuPpi30ngM_H8-I1swIAe56adI](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/nvjkJ-_DQym45CfvwwMpZg_ca752b42a2494e299da71b7025254106_DA_C1M1L2R1_C.png?expiry=1680480000000&hmac=DcCBLQkRhje2oxSbtRuPpi30ngM_H8-I1swIAe56adI)

The group sent the survey out. Great analysts know how to respect both their data and the people who provide it. Since employees provided the data, it was important to make sure all employees gave their consent to participate. The data analysts also made sure employees understood how their data would be **collected, stored, managed, and protected**. Collecting and using data ethically is one of the responsibilities of data analysts. In order to maintain confidentiality and protect and store the data effectively, these were the steps they took:

- They restricted access to the data to a limited number of analysts.
- They cleaned the data to make sure it was complete, correct, and relevant. Certain data was aggregated and summarized without revealing individual responses.
- They uploaded raw data to an internal data warehouse for an additional layer of security.

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/4PjksQFESZK45LEBRCmScw_877ecbe661d24dfbb3a768cf90c742a7_DA_C1M1L2R1_D.png?expiry=1680480000000&hmac=fwyLowbSpQxA6IiqeZyqx2_63sMwt0Z6-hERrrknR2k](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/4PjksQFESZK45LEBRCmScw_877ecbe661d24dfbb3a768cf90c742a7_DA_C1M1L2R1_D.png?expiry=1680480000000&hmac=fwyLowbSpQxA6IiqeZyqx2_63sMwt0Z6-hERrrknR2k)

Then, the analysts did what they do best: analyze! From the completed surveys, the data analysts **discovered** that an employee’s experience with certain processes was a key indicator of overall job satisfaction. These were their findings:

- Employees who experienced a long and complicated hiring process were most likely to leave the company.
- Employees who experienced an efficient and transparent evaluation and feedback process were most likely to remain with the company.

The group knew it was important to **document** exactly what they found in the analysis, no matter what the results. To do otherwise would diminish trust in the survey process and reduce their ability to collect truthful data from employees in the future.

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/LnG2GdNaSGKxthnTWnhiyw_0e857a82d61b414d8333ea02f226c174_DA_C1M1L2R1_E.png?expiry=1680480000000&hmac=VKOfoGMrNsHPrKlKgn2uD4-ZzaOw52-Xk1eOh45mchE](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/LnG2GdNaSGKxthnTWnhiyw_0e857a82d61b414d8333ea02f226c174_DA_C1M1L2R1_E.png?expiry=1680480000000&hmac=VKOfoGMrNsHPrKlKgn2uD4-ZzaOw52-Xk1eOh45mchE)

Just as they made sure the data was carefully protected, the analysts were also careful **sharing the report**. This is how they shared their findings:

- They shared the report with managers who met or exceeded the minimum number of direct reports with submitted responses to the survey.
- They presented the results to the managers to make sure they had the full picture.
- They asked the managers to personally deliver the results to their teams.

This process gave managers an opportunity to **communicate the results** with the right context. As a result, they could have productive team conversations about next steps to improve employee engagement.

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_lmptPOEQfCZqbTzhEHwTw_3a72cd9b1c664666b6d9168b81037439_DA_C1M1L2R1_F.png?expiry=1680480000000&hmac=l-i4y0JOYK11KEPJv2pWWSlovdYOrL7E-0BuSqpBPis](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_lmptPOEQfCZqbTzhEHwTw_3a72cd9b1c664666b6d9168b81037439_DA_C1M1L2R1_F.png?expiry=1680480000000&hmac=l-i4y0JOYK11KEPJv2pWWSlovdYOrL7E-0BuSqpBPis)

The last stage of the process for the team of analysts was to work with leaders within their company and decide how best to **implement changes and take actions** based on the findings. These were their recommendations:

- Standardize the hiring and evaluation process for employees based on the most efficient and transparent practices.
- Conduct the same survey annually and compare results with those from the previous year.

A year later, the same survey was distributed to employees. Analysts anticipated that a comparison between the two sets of results would indicate that the action plan worked. Turns out, the changes improved the retention rate for new employees and the actions taken by leaders were successful!

### Understanding Data Ecosystem:

To put it simply, an ecosystem is a group of elements that interact with one another. Ecosystems can be large, like the jungle in a tropical rainforest or the Australian outback. Or, tiny, like tadpoles in a puddle, or bacteria on your skin. And just like the kangaroos and koala bears in the Australian outback, data lives inside its own ecosystem too. Data ecosystems are made up of various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data. These elements include hardware and software tools, and the people who use them. People like you. Data can also be found in something called the cloud. The cloud is a place to keep data online, rather than on a computer hard drive. So instead of storing data somewhere inside your organization's network, that data is accessed over the internet. So the cloud is just a term we use to describe the virtual location. The cloud plays a big part in the data ecosystem, and as a data analyst, it's your job to harness the power of that data ecosystem, find the right information, and provide the team with analysis that helps them make smart decisions. For example, you could tap into your retail store's database, which is an ecosystem filled with customer names, addresses, previous purchases, and customer reviews. As a data analyst, you could use this information to predict what these customers will buy in the future, and make sure the store has the products and stock when they're needed. As another example, let's think about a data ecosystem used by a human resources department. This ecosystem would include information like postings from job websites, stats on the current labor market, employment rates, and social media data on prospective employees. A data analyst could use this information to help their team recruit new workers and improve employee engagement and retention rates. But data ecosystems aren't just for stores and offices. They work on farms, too. Agricultural companies regularly use data ecosystems that include information including geological patterns in weather movements. Data analysts can use this data to help farmers predict crop yields. Some data analysts are even using data ecosystems to save real environmental ecosystems. At the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, coral reefs all over the world are monitored digitally, so they can see how organisms change over time, track their growth, and measure any increases or declines in individual colonies. The possibilities are endless. Okay, now let's talk about some common misconceptions you might come across. First is the difference between data scientists and data analysts. It's easy to confuse the two, but what they do is actually very different. Data science is defined as creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data. Here's a good way to think about it. Data scientists create new questions using data, while analysts find answers to existing questions by creating insights from data sources. There are also many words and phrases that are easy to get mixed up. For example, data analysis and data analytics sound the same, but they're actually very different things. Let's start with analysis. You've already learned that data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making. Data analytics in the simplest terms is the science of data. It's a very broad concept that encompasses everything from the job of managing and using data to the tools and methods that data workers use each and every day. So when you think about data, data analysis and the data ecosystem, it's important to understand that all of these things fit under the data analytics umbrella.

In our everyday lives, we use data when we wear a fitness tracker or read product reviews to make a purchase decision. And in business, we use data to learn more about our customers, improve processes, and help employees do their jobs more effectively. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. One of the most powerful ways you can put data to work is with data-driven decision-making. Data-driven decision-making is defined as using facts to guide business strategy. Organizations in many different industries are empowered to make better, data-driven decisions by data analysts all the time. The first step in data-driven decision-making is figuring out the business need. Usually, this is a problem that needs to be solved. For example, a problem could be a new company needing to establish better brand recognition, so it can compete with bigger, more well-known competitors. Or maybe an organization wants to improve a product and needs to figure out how to source parts from a more sustainable or ethically responsible supplier. Or, it could be a business trying to solve the problem of unhappy employees, low levels of engagement, satisfaction and retention. Whatever the problem is, once it's defined, a data analyst finds data, analyzes it and uses it to uncover trends, patterns and relationships. Sometimes the data-driven strategy will build on what's worked in the past. Other times, it can guide a business to branch out in a whole new direction. Let's look at a real-world example. Think about a music or movie streaming service. How do these companies know what people want to watch or listen to, and how do they provide it? Well using data-driven decision-making, they gather information about what their customers are currently listening to, analyze it, then use the insights they've gained to make suggestions for things people will most likely enjoy in the future. This keeps customers happy and coming back for more, which in turn means more revenue for the company. Another example of data-driven decision-making can be seen in the rise of e-commerce. It wasn't long ago that most purchases were made in a physical store, but the data showed people's preferences were changing. So a lot of companies created entirely new business models that remove the physical store, and let people shop right from their computers or mobile phones with products delivered right to their doorstep. In fact, data-driven decision-making can be so powerful, it can make entire business methods obsolete. For example, data helped companies completely move away from corded phones and replace them with mobile phones. By ensuring that data is built into every business strategy, data analysts play a critical role in their companies' success, but it's important to note that no matter how valuable data-driven decision-making is, data alone will never be as powerful as data combined with human experience, observation, and sometimes even intuition. To get the most out of data-driven decision-making, it's important to include insights from people who are familiar with the business problem. These people are called subject matter experts, and they have the ability to look at the results of data analysis and identify any inconsistencies, make sense of gray areas, and eventually validate choices being made. Organizations that work this way put data at the heart of every business strategy, but also benefit from the insights of their people. It's a win-win. As a data analyst, you play a key role in empowering these organizations to make data-driven decisions, which is why it's so important for you to understand how data plays a part in the decision-making process.

# Data and gut instinct

Detectives and data analysts have a lot in common. Both depend on facts and clues to make decisions. Both collect and look at the evidence. Both talk to people who know part of the story. And both might even follow some footprints to see where they lead. Whether you’re a detective or a data analyst, your job is all about following steps to collect and understand facts.

Analysts use data-driven decision-making and follow a step-by-step process. You have learned that there are six steps to this process:

1. **Ask** questions and define the problem.
2. **Prepare** data by collecting and storing the information.
3. **Process** data by cleaning and checking the information.
4. **Analyze** data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.
5. **Share** data with your audience.
6. **Act** on the data and use the analysis results.

But there are other factors that influence the decision-making process. You may have read mysteries where the detective used their gut instinct, and followed a hunch that helped them solve the case. **Gut instinct** is an intuitive understanding of something with little or no explanation. This isn’t always something conscious; we often pick up on signals without even realizing. You just have a “feeling” it’s right.

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_5Jrqe73T1-Sa6nu969fAw_6a8919e3eb45468b923ac46f96c4d28b_Screen-Shot-2021-03-02-at-5.45.18-PM.png?expiry=1680912000000&hmac=u-YLle0PrG_apXywlkfypz6sQSjSkanUPbs7s4VownI](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_5Jrqe73T1-Sa6nu969fAw_6a8919e3eb45468b923ac46f96c4d28b_Screen-Shot-2021-03-02-at-5.45.18-PM.png?expiry=1680912000000&hmac=u-YLle0PrG_apXywlkfypz6sQSjSkanUPbs7s4VownI)

**Why gut instinct can be a problem**

At the heart of data-driven decision making is data. Therefore, it's essential that data analysts focus on the data to ensure they make informed decisions. If you ignore data by preferring to make decisions based on your own experience, your decisions may be biased. But even worse, decisions based on gut instinct without any data to back them up can cause mistakes.

Consider an example of a restaurant entrepreneur, partnering with a well known chef to develop a new restaurant in a bustling part of the city’s central shopping district. The well known chef has several restaurants across the city. Banking on their reputation, the restaurant entrepreneur and chef followed gut instinct and created another uniquely themed restaurant. However, fundraising efforts fell short to fund the opening of the restaurant after months of planning and preparation. The property will go back on the market to be sold at a loss. Had the entrepreneur done more research, they would've found data showing prospective customers in this new restaurant location were very different from the chef's other restaurants.

The more you understand the data related to a project, the easier it will be to figure out what is required. These efforts will also help you identify errors and gaps in your data so you can communicate your findings more effectively. Sometimes past experience helps you make a connection that no one else would notice. For example, a detective might be able to crack open a case because they remember an old case just like the one they’re solving today. It's not just gut instinct.

## **Data + business knowledge = mystery solved**

Blending data with business knowledge, plus maybe a touch of gut instinct, will be a common part of your process as a junior data analyst. The key is figuring out the exact mix for each particular project. A lot of times, it will depend on the goals of your analysis. That is why analysts often ask, “How do I define success for this project?”

In addition, try asking yourself these questions about a project to help find the perfect balance:

- What kind of results are needed?
- Who will be informed?
- Am I answering the question being asked?
- How quickly does a decision need to be made?

For instance, if you are working on a rush project, you might need to rely on your own knowledge and experience more than usual. There just isn’t enough time to thoroughly analyze all of the available data. But if you get a project that involves plenty of time and resources, then the best strategy is to be more data-driven. It’s up to you, the data analyst, to make the best possible choice. You will probably blend data and knowledge a million different ways over the course of your data analytics career. And the more you practice, the better you will get at finding that perfect blend.

# Origins of the data analysis process

We also know that data analysis is rooted in statistics, which has a pretty long history itself. Archaeologists mark the start of statistics in ancient Egypt with the building of the pyramids. The ancient Egyptians were masters of organizing data. They documented their calculations and theories on papyri (paper-like materials), which are now viewed as the earliest examples of spreadsheets and checklists. Today’s data analysts owe a lot to those brilliant scribes, who helped create a more technical and efficient process.

It is time to enter the **data analysis life cycle**—the process of going from data to decision. Data goes through several phases as it gets created, consumed, tested, processed, and reused. With a life cycle model, all key team members can drive success by planning work both up front and at the end of the data analysis process. While the data analysis life cycle is well known among experts, there isn't a single defined structure of those phases. There might not be one single architecture that’s uniformly followed by every data analysis expert, but there are some shared fundamentals in every data analysis process. 

The process presented as part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate is one that will be valuable to you as you keep moving forward in your career:

1. **Ask**: Business Challenge/Objective/Question
2. **Prepare**: Data generation, collection, storage, and data management
3. **Process**: Data cleaning/data integrity
4. **Analyze**: Data exploration, visualization, and analysis
5. **Share**: Communicating and interpreting results
6. **Act**: Putting your insights to work to solve the problem

Understanding this process—and all of the iterations that helped make it popular—will be a big part of guiding your own analysis and your work in this program. Let’s go over a few other variations of the data analysis life cycle.

## **EMC's data analysis life cycle**

EMC Corporation's data analytics life cycle is cyclical with six steps:

1. Discovery
2. Pre-processing data
3. Model planning
4. Model building
5. Communicate results
6. Operationalize

EMC Corporation is now Dell EMC. This model, created by David Dietrich, reflects the cyclical nature of real-world projects. The phases aren’t static milestones; each step connects and leads to the next, and eventually repeats. Key questions help analysts test whether they have accomplished enough to move forward and ensure that teams have spent enough time on each of the phases and don’t start modeling before the data is ready. It is a little different from the data analysis life cycle this program is based on, but it has some core ideas in common: the first phase is interested in discovering and asking questions; data has to be prepared before it can be analyzed and used; and then findings should be shared and acted on.

For more information, refer to this e-book, [Data Science & Big Data Analytics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781119183686).

## **SAS's iterative life cycle**

An iterative life cycle was created by a company called **SAS**, a leading data analytics solutions provider. It can be used to produce repeatable, reliable, and predictive results:

1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Explore
4. Model
5. Implement
6. Act
7. Evaluate

The SAS model emphasizes the cyclical nature of their model by visualizing it as an infinity symbol. Their life cycle has seven steps, many of which we have seen in the other models, like Ask, Prepare, Model, and Act. But this life cycle is also a little different; it includes a step after the act phase designed to help analysts evaluate their solutions and potentially return to the ask phase again.

For more information, refer to [Managing the Analytics Life Cycle for Decisions at Scale](https://www.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/en_us/doc/whitepaper1/manage-analytical-life-cycle-continuous-innovation-106179.pdf).

## **Project-based data analytics life cycle**

A project-based data analytics life cycle has five simple steps:

1. Identifying the problem
2. Designing data requirements
3. Pre-processing data
4. Performing data analysis
5. Visualizing data

This data analytics project life cycle was developed by Vignesh Prajapati. It doesn’t include the sixth phase, or what we have been referring to as the Act phase. However, it still covers a lot of the same steps as the life cycles we have already described. It begins with identifying the problem, preparing and processing data before analysis, and ends with data visualization.

For more information, refer to [Understanding the data analytics project life cycle](http://pingax.com/understanding-data-analytics-project-life-cycle/).

## **Big data analytics life cycle**

Authors Thomas Erl, Wajid Khattak, and Paul Buhler proposed a big data analytics life cycle in their book, **Big Data Fundamentals: Concepts, Drivers & Techniques**. Their life cycle suggests phases divided into nine steps:

1. Business case evaluation
2. Data identification
3. Data acquisition and filtering
4. Data extraction
5. Data validation and cleaning
6. Data aggregation and representation
7. Data analysis
8. Data visualization
9. Utilization of analysis results

This life cycle appears to have three or four more steps than the previous life cycle models. But in reality, they have just broken down what we have been referring to as Prepare and Process into smaller steps. It emphasizes the individual tasks required for gathering, preparing, and cleaning data before the analysis phase.

For more information, refer to [Big Data Adoption and Planning Considerations](https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2473128&seqNum=11&ranMID=24808).

## **Key takeaway**

From our journey to the pyramids and data in ancient Egypt to now, the way we analyze data has evolved (and continues to do so). The data analysis process is like real life architecture, there are different ways to do things but the same core ideas still appear in each model of the process.

## **Key data analyst skills:**

When learning new things, sometimes people overlook their own skills, but it's important you take the time to acknowledge them, especially since these skills are going to help you as a data analyst. In fact, you're probably more prepared than you think. Don't believe me? Well, let me prove it. Let's start by defining what I'm talking about here. Analytical skills are qualities and characteristics associated with solving problems using facts. There are a lot of aspects to analytical skills, but, we'll focus on five essential points. They are curiosity, understanding context, having technical mindset, data design, and data strategy. Now, you may be thinking, "I don't have these kinds of skills," or "I only have a couple of them." But stay with me, and I bet you'll change your mind. Let's start with curiosity. Curiosity is all about wanting to learn something. Curious people usually seek out new challenges and experiences. This leads to knowledge. The very fact that you're here with me right now demonstrates that you have curiosity. That was an easy one. Now think about understanding context. Context is the condition in which something exists or happens. This can be a structure or an environment. A simple way of understanding context is by counting to 5. One, two, three, four, five. All of those numbers exist in the context of one through five. But what if a friend of yours said to you, one, two, four, five, three? Well, the three will be out of context. Simple, right? But it can be a little tricky. There's a good chance that you might not even notice the three being out of context if you aren't paying close attention. That's why listening and trying to understand the full picture is critical. In your own life, you put things into context all the time. For example, let's think about your grocery list. If you group together items like flour, sugar, and yeast, that's you adding context to your groceries. This saves you time when you're at the baking aisle at the grocery store. Let's look at another example. Have you ever shuffled a deck of cards and noticed the joker? If you're playing a game that doesn't include jokers, identifying that card means you understand it's out of context. Remove it, and you're much more likely to play a successful game. Now we know you have both curiosity and the ability to understand context. Let's move on to the third skill, a technical mindset. A technical mindset involves the ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way. For instance, when paying your bills, you probably already break down the process into smaller steps. Maybe you start by sorting them by the date they're due. Next, you might add them up and compare that amount to the balance in your bank account. This would help you see if you can pay your bills now, or if you should wait until the next paycheck. Finally, you'd pay them. When you take something that seems like a single task, like paying your bills, and break it into smaller steps with an orderly process, that's using a technical mindset. Now let's explore the fourth part of an analytical skill set, data design. Data design is how you organize information. As a data analyst, design typically has to do with an actual database. But, again, the same skills can easily be applied to everyday life. For example, think about the way you organize the contacts in your phone. That's actually a type of data design. Maybe you list them by first name instead of last, or maybe you use email addresses instead of their names. What you're really doing is designing a clear, logical list that lets you call or text a contact in a quick and simple way. The last, but definitely not least, the fifth and final element of analytical skills is data strategy. Data strategy is the management of the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis. Let's break that down. You manage people by making sure they know how to use the right data to find solutions to the problem you're working on. For processes, it's about making sure the path to that solution is clear and accessible. For tools, you make sure the right technology is being used for the job. Now, you may be doubting my ability to give you an example from real life that demonstrates data strategy. But check this out. Imagine mowing a lawn. Step 1 would be reading the owner's manual for the mower. That's making sure the people involved, or you, in this example, know how to use the data available. The manual would instruct you to put on protective eyewear and closed-toe shoes. Then, it's on to step 2: making the process, the path, clear and accessible. This will involve you walking around the lawn, picking up large sticks or rocks that might get in your way. Finally, for step 3, you check the lawn mower, your tool, to make sure it has enough gas and oil, and is in working condition, so the lawn can be mowed safely. There you have it. Now you know the five essential skills of a data analyst. Curiosity, understanding context, having a technical mindset, data design, and data strategy.

A technical mindset is the ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way.

## **All about thinking analytically:**

People don't often think about thinking. Thinking is second nature to us. It just happens automatically, but there are actually many different ways to think. Some people think creatively, some think critically, and some people think in abstract ways. Let's talk about analytical thinking. Analytical thinking involves identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner. As data analysts, how do we think analytically? Well, to answer that question, we will now talk about a second set of five. The five key aspects to analytical thinking. They are visualization, strategy, problem-orientation, correlation, and finally, big-picture and detail-oriented thinking. Let's start with visualization. In data analytics, visualization is the graphical representation of information. Some examples include graphs, maps, or other design elements. Visualization is important because visuals can help data analysts understand and explain information more effectively. Think about it like this. If you are trying to explain the Grand Canyon to someone, using words would be much more challenging than showing them a picture. A visualization of the Grand Canyon would help you make your point much quicker. Now let's talk about the second part of analytical thinking, being strategic. With so much data available, having a strategic mindset is key to staying focused and on track. Strategizing helps data analysts see what they want to achieve with the data and how they can get there. Strategy also helps improve the quality and usefulness of the data we collect. By strategizing, we know all our data is valuable and can help us accomplish our goals. Next step on the analytical thinking checklist: being problem-oriented. Data analysts use a problem- oriented approach in order to identify, describe, and solve problems. It's all about keeping the problem top of mind throughout the entire project. For example, say a data analyst is told about the problem of a warehouse constantly running out of supplies. They would move forward with different strategies and processes. But the number one goal would always be solving the problem of keeping inventory on the shelves. Data analysts also ask a lot of questions. This helps improve communication and saves time while working on a solution. An example of that would be surveying customers about their experiences using a product and building insights from those questions to improve their product. This leads us to the fourth quality of analytical thinking: being able to identify a correlation between two or more pieces of data. A correlation is like a relationship. You can find all kinds of correlations in data. Maybe it's the relationship between the length of your hair and the amount of shampoo you need. Or maybe you notice a correlation between a rainier season leading to a high number of umbrellas being sold. But as you start identifying correlations in data, there's one thing you always want to keep in mind: Correlation does not equal causation. In other words, just because two pieces of data are both trending in the same direction, that doesn't necessarily mean they are all related. We'll learn more about that later. Now the final piece of the analytical thinking puzzle: big-picture thinking. This means being able to see the big picture as well as the details. A jigsaw puzzle is a great way to think about this. Big-picture thinking is like looking at a complete puzzle. You can enjoy the whole picture without getting stuck on every tiny piece that went into making it. If you only focus on individual pieces, you wouldn't be able to see past that, which is why big-picture thinking is so important. It helps you zoom out and see possibilities and opportunities. This leads to exciting new ideas or innovations. On the flip side, detail-oriented thinking is all about figuring out all of the aspects that will help you execute a plan. In other words, the pieces that make up your puzzle. There are all kinds of problems in the business world that can benefit from employees who have both a big-picture and a detail-oriented way of thinking. Most of us are naturally better at one or the other. But you can always develop the skills to fit both pieces together. Now that you know the five aspects of analytical thinking, visualization, strategy, problem-orientation, correlation, and big-picture and detail-oriented thinking, you can put them to work for you when you're working with data.

## **Exploring core analytical skills:**

Let's recap what we've learned about analytical thinking so far. The 5 key aspects are visualization, strategy, problem-orientation, correlation, and using big-picture and detail-oriented thinking. We've seen how you already use them in your everyday life. We also talked about how different people naturally use certain types of thinking, but that you can absolutely grow and develop the skills that might not come as easily to you. This means you can become a versatile thinker, which is a very important part of data analysis. You might naturally be an analytical thinker, but you can learn to think creatively and critically, and be great at all three. The more ways you can think, the easier it is to think outside the box and come up with fresh ideas. But why is it important to think in different ways? Well because in data analysis, solutions are almost never right in front of you. You need to think critically to find out the right questions to ask. But you also need to think creatively to get new and unexpected answers. Let's talk about some of the questions data analysts ask when they're on the hunt for a solution. Here's one that will come up a lot: What is the root cause of a problem? A root cause is the reason why a problem occurs. If we can identify and get rid of a root cause, we can prevent that problem from happening again. A simple way to wrap your head around root causes is with the process called the Five Whys. In the Five Whys you ask "why" five times to reveal the root cause. The fifth and final answer should give you some useful and sometimes surprising insights. Here's an example of the Five Whys in action. Let's say you wanted to make a blueberry pie but couldn't find any blueberries. You've been trying to solve a problem by asking, why can't I make a blueberry pie? The answer will be, there are no blueberries at the store. There's Why Number 1. You then ask, why were there no blueberries at the store? Then you discover that the blueberry bushes don't have enough fruit this season. That's Why Number 2. Next, you'd ask, why was there not enough fruit? This would lead to the fact that birds were eating all the berries. Why Number 3, asked and answered. Now we get to Why Number 4. Ask why a fourth time and the answer would be that, although the birds normally prefer mulberries and don't eat blueberries, the mulberry bush didn't produce fruit this season, so the birds are eating blueberries instead. Finally, we get to Why Number 5, which should reveal the root cause. A late frost damaged the mulberry bushes, so it didn't produce any fruit. You can't make a blueberry pie because of the late frost months ago. See how the Five Whys can reveal some very surprising root causes. This is a great trick to know, and it can be a very helpful process in data analysis. Another question commonly asked by data analysts is, where are the gaps in our process? For this, many people will use something called gap analysis. Gap analysis lets you examine and evaluate how a process works currently in order to get where you want to be in the future. Businesses conduct gap analysis to do all kinds of things, such as improve a product or become more efficient. The general approach to gap analysis is understanding where you are now compared to where you want to be. Then you can identify the gaps that exist between the current and future state and determine how to bridge them. A third question that data analysts ask a lot is, what did we not consider before? This is a great way to think about what information or procedure might be missing from a process, so you can identify ways to make better decisions and strategies moving forward. These are just a few examples of the kinds of questions data analysts use at their jobs every day. As you begin your career, I'm sure you'll think of a whole lot more. The way data analysts think and ask questions plays a big part in how businesses make decisions. That's why analytical thinking and understanding how to ask the right questions can have such a huge impact on the overall success of a business. Later, we'll talk more about how data-driven decisions can lead to successful outcomes.

## Summary:

Analytical thinking involves identifying and defining a problem, then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner.

Gap analysis is used to examine and evaluate how a process currently works with the goal of getting to where you want to be in the future.

Correlation involves being able to identify a relationship between two or more pieces of data. A correlation is like a relationship.

Graphs, maps, and charts are used in data visualization.

## ****Using data to drive successful outcomes:****

let's look at the concept of data-driven decision-making and why it's more likely to lead to successful outcomes. You might remember that data-driven decision-making involved using facts to guide business strategy. Data analysts can tap into the power of data to do all kinds of amazing things. With data, they can gain valuable insights, verify their theories or assumptions, better understand opportunities and challenges, support an objective, help make a plan, and much more. In business, data-driven decision-making can improve the results in a lot of different ways. For example, say a dairy farmer wants to start making and selling ice cream. They could guess what flavors customers would like, but there's a better way to get the information. The farmer could survey people and ask them what flavors they prefer. This gives the farmer the data they need to pick ice cream flavors people will enjoy. Here's another example. Let's say the president of an organization is curious about what perks employees value most. She asked the human resources director who says people value casual dress code. It's a gut feeling, but the HR director backs it up with the fact that he sees a lot of people wearing jeans and t-shirts. But what if this company were to use a more structured employee feedback process, such as a survey? It might reveal that employees actually enjoy free public transportation cards the most. The human resources director just didn't realize that because he drives to work. These are just some of the benefits of data-driven decision-making. It gives you greater confidence about your choice and your abilities to address business challenges. It helps you become more proactive when an opportunity presents itself, and it saves you time and effort when working towards a goal. Now let's learn more about how these five skills help you tap into all the potential of data-driven decision-making. First, think about curiosity and context. The more you learn about the power of data, the more curious you're likely to become. You'll start to see patterns and relationships in everyday life, whether you're reading the news, watching a movie, or going to an appointment across town. The analysts take their thinking a step further by using context to make predictions, research answers, and eventually draw conclusions about what they've discovered. This natural process is a great first step in becoming more data-driven. Having a technical mindset comes next. Everyone has instincts, or as in the case of our human resources director example, gut feelings. Data analysts are no different. They have gut feelings too. But they've trained themselves to build on those feelings and use a more technical approach to explore them. They do this by always seeking out the facts, putting them to work through analysis, and using the insights they gain to make informed decisions. Next, we come to data design, which has a strong connection to data-driven decision-making. To put it simply, designing your data so that it is organized in a logical way makes it easy for data analysts to access, understand, and make the most of available information. And it's important to keep in mind that data design doesn't just apply to databases. This kind of thinking can work with all sorts of real-life situations too. The basic idea is this. If you make decisions that are informed by data, you are more likely to make more informed and effective decisions. The final ability is data strategy, which incorporates the people, processes, and tools used to solve a problem. This is a big one to remember because data strategy gives you a high-level view of the path you need to take to achieve your goals. Also, data-driven decision-making isn't a one-person job. It's much more likely to be successful if everyone is on board and on the same page, so it's important to make sure specific procedures are in place and that your technology being used is aligned with your data-driven strategy. Now you know how these five essential analytical skills work towards making better, data-driven decisions. So far, many of the examples you've heard are hypothetical. That means they could be true in theory, but aren't specific real-world cases. Next, we'll look at some real examples.

# Real-world data magic

I Each of these scenarios shows off the power of data-driven decision-making in unexpected ways. The first story is about Google. As I mentioned a little while back, here at Google, our mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. All of our products, from idea to development to launch, are built on data and data-driven decision-making. There are tons of examples here at Google of people using facts to create business strategy. But one of the most famous ones has to do with Google's human resources. Here's how it went. The HR department wanted to know if there was value in having managers. Were their contributions worthwhile? Or should everyone just be an individual contributor? To answer that question, Google's people analytics team looked at past performance reviews and employee surveys. The data they found was plotted on a graph because as you've learned, visuals are extremely helpful when trying to understand a problem or concept. The graph revealed that Googlers had positive feelings about their managers, but the data was pretty general and the team wanted to learn more. So they dug deeper and split the data into quartiles. A quartile divides data points into four equal parts or quarters. Here's where the really cool stuff started happening. The data analysts discovered that there was a big difference between the very top and the very bottom quartiles. As it turned out, the teams with the best managers were significantly happier, more productive, and more likely to want to keep working at Google. This confirmed that managers were valued and make a big difference. Therefore, the idea of having only individual contributors was not implemented. But there was still more work to do. Just knowing that great managers create great results doesn't lead to actionable insights. You have to identify what exactly makes a great manager, so the team took two additional steps to collect more data. First, they launched an awards program where employees could nominate their favorite managers. For every submission you had to provide examples or data about what makes that manager great. The second step involved interviewing managers who were graphed on the top and bottom quartiles. This helped the analytics team see the differences between successful and less successful management behaviors. The best behaviors were identified as were the most common reasons for a manager needing improvement. The final step was sharing these insights and putting a procedure in place for evaluating managers with these qualities in mind. This data-driven decision continues to create an exceptional company culture for my colleagues and me. Thanks, data. Another interesting example comes from the nonprofit sector. Nonprofits are organizations dedicated to advancing a social cause or advocating for a particular effort, such as food security, education or the arts. In this case, data analysts researched how journalists can make a more meaningful impact for the nonprofits they would write about. Because journalists write for newspapers, magazines, and other news outlets, they can help nonprofits reach readers like you and me, who then take action to help nonprofits reach their goals. For instance, say you read about the problem of climate change in an online magazine. If the article is effective, you'll learn more about the cause and might even be compelled to make greener choices in your day-to-day life, volunteer for a nonprofit, or make a donation. That's an example of the journalist's work bringing about awareness, understanding, and engagement. So, back to the story. The data analysts used a tracker to monitor story topics, clicks, web traffic, comments, shares and more. Then they evaluated the information to make recommendations for how the journalists could do their jobs even better. In the end, they came up with some great ideas for how nonprofits and journalists can motivate people everywhere to work together and make the world a better place. There's really no end to what you can do as a data analyst. As you progress through this program, you'll discover even more possibilities. Great job following along with the topics of these past few videos. You learned all about analytical skills and the five key characteristics of data analysts. You probably even learned that you are a pro at most of these already. Next, you discovered what it means to think analytically and the specific skills data analysts develop to help them do it. You explored tools and processes that enable data analysts to pinpoint a problem and ask the right questions in order to solve them. Finally, some real-world stories helped illustrate why data-driven decision-making is usually more successful than other methods. You're building a wonderful foundation for your career as a data analyst.

## **Learning about data phases and tools:**

As a quick refresher, the data analysis process phases are ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. You might remember me saying earlier that this entire program is modeled after these steps. Now, we're going to really dig in and explore how each of these phases work together. But I'm getting a little ahead of myself. First, let's spend a little time understanding the data life cycle. No, data isn't actually alive, but it does have a life cycle. How do data analysts bring data to life? Well, it starts with the right data analysis tool. These include spreadsheets, databases, query languages, and visualization software. Don't worry if you don't know how these work, or even what they are. At one point, every data analyst has been right where you are right now, and they probably had a lot of the same questions. I remember when I first started learning about spreadsheets. I was a young intern, and the company I was working for was in the middle of a big systems change. That meant, we had to move tons of reports from the old system to the new one. After a few weeks, I noticed that even the people who were further in their careers were not as technically minded as I was. That became a great opportunity for me to add value. My aha spreadsheet moment came when I started researching shortcuts that I could use to work with the spreadsheets more efficiently. This would really streamline the process of getting those reports moved over to the new system. Once everything started flowing, I remember getting emails from other finance analysts at the company. They were so grateful that someone had come in and fixed a problem that no one else could. That inspired me to go even further and learn how to use spreadsheets in all sorts of incredible ways.

**Phase 1**

**Ask:** Define the problem and confirm stakeholder expectations

**Phase 2**

**Prepare:** Collect and store data for analysis

**Phase 3**

**Process:** Clean and transform data to ensure integrity

**Phase 4**

**Analyze:** Use data analysis tools to draw conclusions

**Phase 5**

**Share:** Interpret and communicate results to others to make data-driven decisions

**Phase 6**

**Act:** Put your insights to work in order to solve the original problem

## **Stages of the data life cycle:**

One of the most well known examples of a life cycle is a butterfly. Butterflies begin as eggs, hatch into caterpillars and then become a chrysalis. That's where the real magic happens. Data has a life cycle of its own too. In this video, we're going to talk about each of the stages in that life cycle to help you understand the individual phases data goes through. The life cycle of data is plan, capture, manage, analyze, archive and destroy. Let's start with the first phase, planning. This actually happens well before starting an analysis project. During planning, a business decides what kind of data it needs, how it will be managed throughout its life cycle, who will be responsible for it, and the optimal outcomes. For example, let's say an electricity provider wanted to gain insights into how to save people energy. In the planning phase, they might decide to capture information on how much electricity its customers use each year, what types of buildings are being powered, and what types of devices are being powered inside of them. The electricity company would also decide which team members will be responsible for collecting, storing, and sharing that data. All of this happens during planning, and it helps set up the rest of the project. The next phase is when you capture data. This is where data is collected from a variety of different sources and brought into the organization. With so much data being created everyday, the ways to collect it are truly endless. One common method is getting data from outside resources. For example, if you were doing data analysis on weather patterns, you'd probably get data from a publicly available dataset like the National Climatic Data Center. Another way to get data is from a company's own documents and files, which are usually stored inside a database. While we've mentioned databases before, we haven't gone into too much detail about what they are. A database is a collection of data stored in a computer system. In the case of our electricity provider, the business would probably measure data usage among its customers within a database that it owns. As a quick note, when you maintain a database of customer information, ensuring data integrity, credibility, and privacy are all important concerns. You'll learn a lot more about that later on. Now that we've captured our data, we'll move on to the next phase of the data life cycle, manage. Here we're talking about how we care for our data, how and where it's stored, the tools used to keep it safe and secure, and the actions taken to make sure that it's maintained properly. This phase is very important to data cleansing, which we'll cover later on. Next it's time to analyze your data. This is where data analysts really shine. In this phase, the data is used to solve problems, make great decisions, and support business goals. For example, one of our electricity company's goals might be to find ways to help customers save energy. Moving along the data life cycle now evolves to the archive phase. Archiving means storing data in a place where it's still available, but may not be used again. During analysis, analysts handle huge amounts of data. Can you imagine if we had to sort through all of the available data that's out there, even if it was no longer useful and relevant to our work? It makes way more sense to archive it than to keep it around. And finally, the last step of the data life cycle, the destroy phase. Yes, it sounds sad, but when you destroy data, it won't hurt a bit. So let's get back to our electricity provider example. They would have data stored on multiple hard drives. To destroy it, the company would use a secure data erasure software. If there were any paper files, they would be shredded too. This is important for protecting a company's private information, as well as private data about its customers. And there you have it, the data life cycle.

# Variations of the data life cycle

You learned that there are six stages to the data life cycle. Here is a recap:

1. **Plan:** Decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it.
2. **Capture:** Collect or bring in data from a variety of different sources.
3. **Manage:** Care for and maintain the data. This includes determining how and where it is stored and the tools used to do so.
4. **Analyze:** Use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals.
5. **Archive:** Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference.
6. **Destroy:** Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data.

**Warning:** Be careful not to mix up or confuse the six stages of the data life cycle (Plan, Capture, Manage, Analyze, Archive, and Destroy) with the six phases of the data analysis life cycle (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act). They shouldn't be used or referred to interchangeably.

The data life cycle provides a generic or common framework for how data is managed. You may recall that variations of the data analysis life cycle were described in [Origins of the data analysis process](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/supplement/WWlrt/origins-of-the-data-analysis-process). The same can be done for the data life cycle. The rest of this reading provides a glimpse of how government, finance, and education institutions can view data life cycles a little differently.

## **U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service**

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uses the following data life cycle:

1. Plan
2. Acquire
3. Maintain
4. Access
5. Evaluate
6. Archive

For more information, refer to [U.S. Fish and Wildlife's Data Management Life Cycle](https://www.fws.gov/data/life-cycle) page.

## **The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)**

The USGS uses the data life cycle below:

1. Plan
2. Acquire
3. Process
4. Analyze
5. Preserve
6. Publish/Share

Several cross-cutting or overarching activities are also performed during each stage of their life cycle:

- Describe (metadata and documentation)
- Manage Quality
- Backup and Secure

For more information, refer to the [USGS Data Lifecycle](https://www.usgs.gov/products/data-and-tools/data-management/data-lifecycle) page.

## **Financial institutions**

Financial institutions may take a slightly different approach to the data life cycle as described in [The Data Life Cycle](https://sfmagazine.com/post-entry/july-2018-the-data-life-cycle/), an article in Strategic Finance magazine:

1. Capture
2. Qualify
3. Transform
4. Utilize
5. Report
6. Archive
7. Purge

## **Harvard Business School (HBS)**

One final data life cycle informed by Harvard University research has eight stages:

1. Generation
2. Collection
3. Processing
4. Storage
5. Management
6. Analysis
7. Visualization
8. Interpretation

For more information, refer to [8 Steps in the Data Life Cycle](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-life-cycle).

## **Key takeaway**

Understanding the importance of the data life cycle will set you up for success as a data analyst. Individual stages in the data life cycle will vary from company to company or by industry or sector. Historical data is important to both the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the USGS, so their data life cycle focuses on archiving and backing up data. Harvard's interests are in research and teaching, so its data life cycle includes visualization and interpretation even though these are more often associated with a data analysis life cycle. The HBS data life cycle also doesn't call out a stage for purging or destroying data. In contrast, the data life cycle for finance clearly identifies archive and purge stages. To sum it up, although data life cycles vary, one data management principle is universal. Govern how data is handled so that it is accurate, secure, and available to meet your organization's needs.

# Six phases of data analysis

Now that you understand all the phases of the data life cycle, it's time to move on to the phases of data analysis. They sound similar, but are two different things. Data analysis isn't a life cycle. It's the process of analyzing data. Coming up, we'll look at each step of the data analysis process and how it will relate to your work as a data analyst. Even this program is designed to follow these steps. Understanding these connections will help guide your own analysis and your work in this program. You've already learned that this program is modeled after the stages of the data analysis process. This program is split into courses, six of which are based upon the steps of data analysis: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. Let's start with the first step in data analysis, the ask phase. In this phase, we do two things. We define the problem to be solved and we make sure that we fully understand stakeholder expectations. Stakeholders hold a stake in the project. They are people who have invested time and resources into a project and are interested in the outcome. Let's break that down. First, defining a problem means you look at the current state and identify how it's different from the ideal state. Usually there's an obstacle we need to get rid of or something wrong that needs to be fixed. For instance, a sports arena might want to reduce the time fans spend waiting in the ticket line. The obstacle is figuring out how to get the customers to their seats more quickly. Another important part of the ask phase is understanding stakeholder expectations. The first step here is to determine who the stakeholders are. That may include your manager, an executive sponsor, or your sales partners. There can be lots of stakeholders. But what they all have in common is that they help make decisions, influence actions and strategies, and have specific goals they want to meet. They also care about the project and that's why it's so important to understand their expectations. For instance, if your manager assigns you a data analysis project related to business risk, it would be smart to confirm whether they want to include all types of risks that could affect the company, or just risks related to weather such as hurricanes and tornadoes. Communicating with your stakeholders is key in making sure you stay engaged and on track throughout the project. So as a data analyst, developing strong communication strategies is very important. This part of the ask phase helps you keep focused on the problem itself, not just its symptoms. As you learned earlier, the five whys are extremely helpful here. I After that, we'll move on to the prepare step of the data analysis process. This is where data analysts collect and store data they'll use for the upcoming analysis process. You'll learn more about the different types of data and how to identify which kinds of data are most useful for solving a particular problem. You'll also discover why it's so important that your data and results are objective and unbiased. In other words, any decisions made from your analysis should always be based on facts and be fair and impartial. Next is the process step. Here, data analysts find and eliminate any errors and inaccuracies that can get in the way of results. This usually means cleaning data, transforming it into a more useful format, combining two or more datasets to make information more complete and removing outliers, which are any data points that could skew the information. After that, you'll learn how to check the data you prepare to make sure it's complete and correct. This phase is all about getting the details right. So you'll also fix typos, inconsistencies, or missing and inaccurate data. To top it off, you'll gain strategies for verifying and sharing your data cleansing with stakeholders. Then it's time to analyze. Analyzing the data you've collected involves using tools to transform and organize that information so that you can draw useful conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making. There are lots of powerful tools data analysts use in their work and in this course you'll learn about two of them, spreadsheets and structured query language, or SQL, which is often pronounced "sequel." The next course is based on the share phase. Here you'll learn how data analysts interpret results and share them with others to help stakeholders make effective data-driven decisions. In the share phase, visualization is a data analyst's best friend. So this course will highlight why visualization is essential to getting others to understand what your data is telling you. With the right visuals, facts and figures become so much easier to see and complex concepts become easier to understand. We'll explore different kinds of visuals and some great data visualization tools. You'll also practice your own presentation skills by creating compelling slideshows and learning how to be fully prepared to answer questions. Then we'll take a break from the data analysis process to show you all of the really cool things you can do with the programming language R. You don't need to be familiar with R or programming languages in general. Just know that R is a popular tool for data manipulation, calculation, and visualization. For our final data analysis phase, we have act. This is the exciting moment when the business takes all of the insights you, the data analyst, have provided and puts them to work in order to solve the original business problem and will be acting on what you've learned throughout this program. This is when you prepare for your job search and have the chance to complete a case study project. It's a great opportunity for you to bring together everything you've worked on throughout this course. Plus adding a case study to your portfolio helps you stand out from the other candidates when you interview for your first data analyst job.

# Example of the data process:

Regardless of what type of data analysis you're conducting, the process is generally the same. The example that I'll walk through is that of our employee engagement survey, but you could imagine that this process applies to just about any data analysis that you're going to conduct as an analyst. The first thing you want to do is ask. You want to ask all of the right questions at the beginning of the engagement so that you better understand what your leaders and stakeholders need from this analysis. The types of questions that I generally ask are around, what is the problem that we're trying to solve? What is the purpose of this analysis? What are we hoping to learn from it? After you've asked all the right questions and you've wrapped your arms around the scope of the analysis you need to conduct, the next step is to prepare. We need to be thinking about what type of data we need to answer those key questions. This could be anything from quantitative data or qualitative data. It could be cross-sectional or points in time versus longitudinal over a long period of time. We need to be thinking about the type of data we need in order to answer the questions that we've set out to answer based on what we learned when we asked the right questions. We also need to be thinking about how we're going to collect that data or if we need to collect that data. It may be the case that we need to collect this data brand-new. So we need to think about what type of data we're going to be collecting and how. For our employee engagement survey, we do that via survey of both quantitative and qualitative questions. But it may actually be the case that for many analyses, the data that you're looking for already exist. Then it's a question of working with those data owners to make sure that you are able to leverage that data and use it responsibly. After you've done all the hard work to collect your data, now you need to process that data. It begins with cleaning. This to me is the most fun part of the data analytics process. We can think of it as the initial introduction or the handshake, hello, to your data. This is where you get a chance to understand its structure, its quirks, its nuances, and you really get a chance to understand deeply what type of data you're going to be working with and understanding what potential that data has to answer all of your questions. This is such an important part, too, where we're running through all of our quality assurance checks. For example, do we have all of the data that we anticipated we would have? Are we missing data at random or is it missing in a systematic way such that maybe something went wrong with our data collection effort? If needed, did we code all of our data the right way? Are there any outliers that we need to treat differently? This is the part where we spend a lot of time really digging deeply into the structure and nuance of the data to make sure that you're able to analyze it appropriately and responsibly. After cleaning our data and running all of our quality assurance checks, now is the point where we analyze our data, making sure to do so in as objective and unbiased a way as possible. To do this, the first thing we do is run through a series of analyses that we've already planned ahead of time based on the questions that we know we want to answer from the very, very beginning of the process. One thing that's probably the hardest about this particular process, the hardest thing about analyzing data, is that we as analysts are trained to look for patterns. Over time as we become better and better at our jobs, what we'll often find is that we can start to intuit what we might see in the data. We might have a sneaking suspicion as to what the data are going to tell us. This is the point where we have to take a step back and let the data speak for itself. As data analysts, we are storytellers, but we also have to keep in mind that it is not our story to tell. That story belongs to the data, and it is our job as analysts to amplify and tell that story in as unbiased and objective a way as possible. The next step is to share all of the data and insights that you've generated from your analyses. Now typically for employee engagement survey, we start by sharing the high-level findings with our executive team. We want them to have a landscape view of how the organization is feeling, and we want to make sure that there aren't any surprises as they dig deeper and deeper into the data to understand how teams are feeling and how individual employees are feeling. All of this work from asking the right questions to collecting your data, to analyzing and sharing, doesn't mean much of anything if we aren't taking action on what we've just learned. This to me is the most critical part, especially of our employee engagement survey. I like to say that the survey is actually the easy part, and acting on the results is really where the real work begins. This is where we use all of those data-driven insights to decide what types of interventions we want to introduce, not only at the organizational level, but also at the team level as well. We might find, for example, that the organization is working on a series of interventions to help improve part of the employee experience, whereas individual teams have additional roles, responsibilities to play, to either bolster some of those efforts or to introduce new ones to better meet their team where their strengths and opportunity areas are. The data analysis process is rigorous, but it is lengthy. I can completely appreciate that we as data analysts, get so excited about just diving right into the data and doing what we do best. The challenge is that if we don't work through the process in its entirety, if we try to skip steps, we're not going to be able to elicit the insights that we're looking for.

# Exploring data analyst tools

Introducing you to some of the tools data analyst use each and every day. There are tons of options out there. But the most common ones you'll see analyst use are spreadsheets, query languages and visualization tools.  Let's get started with spreadsheets. Again, there are lots of different spreadsheet solutions, but two popular options are Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. To put it simply, a spreadsheet is a digital worksheet. It stores, organizes, and sorts data. This is important because the usefulness of your data depends on how well it's structured. When you put your data into a spreadsheet, you can see patterns, group information and easily find the information you need. Spreadsheets also have some really useful features called formulas and functions. A formula is a set of instructions that performs a specific calculation using the data in a spreadsheet. Formulas can do basic things like add, subtract, multiply and divide, but they don't stop there. You can also use formulas to find the average of a number set. Look up a particular value, return the sum of a set of values that meets a particular rule, and so much more. A function is a preset command that automatically performs a specific process or task using the data in a spreadsheet. That sounds pretty technical, I know, so let's break it down. Just think of a function as a simpler, more efficient way of doing something that would normally take a lot of time. In other words, functions can help make you more efficient. Those are the spreadsheet basics for now. Later on, you'll see them in action and start working with spreadsheets yourself. The next data analysis tool is called query language. A query language is a computer programming language that allows you to retrieve and manipulate data from a database. You'll learn something called structured query language, more commonly known as SQL. SQL is a language that lets data analysts communicate with a database. A database is a collection of data stored in a computer system. SQL is the most widely used structured query language for a couple of reasons. It's easy to understand and works very well with all kinds of databases. With SQL, data analysts can access the data they need by making a query. Although query means question, I like to think of it as more of a request. So you're requesting that the database do something for you. You can ask it to do a lot of different things such as insert, delete, select or update data. Okay, that's a top level look at SQL. In a later video, we'll explore it further and use SQL to do some really cool things with data. Lastly, let's talk about data visualization. You've learned that data visualization is the graphical representation of information. Some examples include graphs, maps, and tables. Most people process visuals more easily than words alone. That's why visualizations are so important. They help data analysts communicate their insights to others, in an effective and compelling way. When you think about the data analysis process, after data is prepared, processed and analyzed, the insights are visualized so it can be understood and shared. This makes it easier for stakeholders to draw conclusions, make decisions, and come up with strategies. Some popular visualization tools are Tableau and Looker. Data analysts like using Tableau because it helps them create visuals that are very easy to understand. This means that even non-technical users can get the information they need. Looker is also popular with data analysts because it gives them an easy way to create visuals based on the results of a query. With Looker, you can give stakeholders a complete picture of your work by showing them visualization data and the actual data related to it. All visualization tools have great features that are useful in different situations. Soon you will learn how to decide which tool to use for a particular job. And that's everything you need to know about the data life cycle and the data analysis process..

# Key data analyst tools

As you are learning, the most common programs and solutions used by data analysts include spreadsheets, query languages, and visualization tools. In this reading, you will learn more about each one. You will cover when to use them, and why they are so important in data analytics.

## **Spreadsheets**

Data analysts rely on spreadsheets to collect and organize data. Two popular spreadsheet applications you will probably use a lot in your future role as a data analyst are Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.

Spreadsheets structure data in a meaningful way by letting you

- Collect, store, organize, and sort information
- Identify patterns and piece the data together in a way that works for each specific data project
- Create excellent data visualizations, like graphs and charts.

## **Databases and query languages**

A database is a collection of structured data stored in a computer system. Some popular Structured Query Language (SQL) programs include MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and BigQuery.

Query languages

- Allow analysts to isolate specific information from a database(s)
- Make it easier for you to learn and understand the requests made to databases
- Allow analysts to select, create, add, or download data from a database for analysis

## **Visualization tools**

Data analysts use a number of visualization tools, like graphs, maps, tables, charts, and more. Two popular visualization tools are Tableau and Looker.

These tools

- Turn complex numbers into a story that people can understand
- Help stakeholders come up with conclusions that lead to informed decisions and effective business strategies
- Have multiple features

- **Tableau**'s simple drag-and-drop feature lets users create interactive graphs in dashboards and

worksheets

- **Looker** communicates directly with a database, allowing you to connect your data right to the visual

tool you choose

A career as a data analyst also involves using programming languages, like R and Python, which are used a lot for statistical analysis, visualization, and other data analysis.

# Choosing the right tool for the job

As a data analyst, you will usually have to decide which program or solution is right for the particular project you are working on. In this reading, you will learn more about how to choose which tool you need and when.

Depending on which phase of the data analysis process you’re in, you will need to use different tools. For example, if you are focusing on creating complex and eye-catching visualizations, then the visualization tools we discussed earlier are the best choice. But if you are focusing on organizing, cleaning, and analyzing data, then you will probably be choosing between spreadsheets and databases using queries. Spreadsheets and databases both offer ways to store, manage, and use data. The basic content for both tools are sets of values. Yet, there are some key differences, too:

| Spreadsheets | Databases |
| --- | --- |
| Software applications | Data stores - accessed using a query language (e.g. SQL) |
| Structure data in a row and column format | Structure data using rules and relationships |
| Organize information in cells | Organize information in complex collections |
| Provide access to a limited amount of data | Provide access to huge amounts of data |
| Manual data entry | Strict and consistent data entry |
| Generally one user at a time | Multiple users |
| Controlled by the user | Controlled by a database management system |

You don’t have to choose one or the other because each serves its own purpose. Generally, data analysts work with a combination of the two, as both tools are very useful in data analytics. For example, you can store data in a database, then export it to a spreadsheet for analysis. Or, if you are collecting information in a spreadsheet, and it becomes too much for that particular platform, you can import it into a database.

## **Columns and rows and cells, oh my!**

Spreadsheets are a big part of data analytics. The sooner you make friends with spreadsheets, the better. Trust me, they'll save you a lot of time as a data analyst and make your whole job easier. This spreadsheet is one example of how an organized spreadsheet might look. In this video, we'll demonstrate some of the basic spreadsheet concepts for all of you who are new to this world. This might be a review for some of you more experienced folks out there, but it never hurts to practice what you know. Plus, you might still learn a trick or two. I showed you this image earlier. Let's explore it further because it's a great example of the three main features of a spreadsheet: cells, rows, and columns. They'll be part of almost everything you do in a spreadsheet for making a simple grocery list to analyzing a complex dataset. I use spreadsheets to manage everything from my own personal finances to the annual homecoming party my friends and I have every year. I'm the planner, so I use a spreadsheet to keep things in order, making sure we have everything we need. Speaking of keeping things in order, columns are organized vertically in a spreadsheet and are ordered by letter. And the rows are organized horizontally and are ordered by number. So when you talk about a specific cell, you name it by combining the column letter and the row number where the cell is located. For example, in this spreadsheet, the word row is in cell D3. Let's get started in an actual spreadsheet. You can complete all of the steps in just about any spreadsheet program. Let's get to know your spreadsheet a little better now. We'll start with some basic operations. Keep in mind, as an analyst, you won't always create your own dataset. But for now, let's do just that. I'll click in cell A2 and type my first name like this. Then I'll click in cell B2 and type my last name.

![Screenshot (371).png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/44d30943-dad7-4e23-8c6f-c5d09250810f/Screenshot_(371).png)

Don't worry if your name doesn't fit in the cell, you can always make columns wider if you need to. All you have to do is click and drag the right edge of the column until your name fits. Or you can use the text wrapping feature, which will set cells to automatically change their height to allow the text in the cell to fit. To use this feature, select the cells, columns, or rows with text, then use the format menu to look at the text wrapping options. It is automatically set to allow the text to overflow out of the cell. But you can wrap the text instead so all of the text is visible. The clip option will cut off the text in the cell so only the text that fits is visible. There it is. We've added data. Now let's label it. This is important for organization. Adding labels to the top of the columns will make it easier to reference and find data later on when you're doing analysis. These column labels are usually called attributes. An attribute is a characteristic or quality of data used to label a column in a table. More commonly, attributes are referred to as column names, column labels, headers, or the header row. Let's add some headers to our table. I'll click in cell A1 and type the words first name.

![Screenshot (372).png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/45e1e27f-d258-4a38-9309-3a953afc72e2/Screenshot_(372).png)

In cell B1 I'll type last name. We'll make these attributes bold so they stand out more. Spreadsheets can get really big, so you want to make sure your data is clearly labeled and easy to find. I can use my cursor to select the cells with the attributes. Then I'll click the bold icon to make them bold. Looking good so far. Ready to add some more data? Let's start with some new attributes. First, I'll add a column for the number of siblings by typing siblings in cell C1.

Play video starting at :4:27 and follow transcript4:27

Then I'll add two more attributes in the next two columns. Let's go with favorite color and favorite dessert. I'll make them bold too. To fit the labels in the cells, I'll adjust the size of the columns just like before.

Play video starting at :4:48 and follow transcript4:48

Now, keep in mind, there are more ways to adjust the size of the columns and rows. If you have questions about using spreadsheets, a quick search online will usually help you find what you need. We've also included a reading with more tips and information about spreadsheets. OK, let's get back to it. Now, I can add my own data to the dataset. I'll type in how many siblings I have and my favorite color and dessert in the appropriate cells.

Play video starting at :5:25 and follow transcript5:25

Next, I'll add data for two more people.

Play video starting at :5:32 and follow transcript5:32

We now have three rows of data. In a dataset, a row is also called an observation. An observation includes all of the attributes for something contained in a row of a data table. In this case, row 3 is an observation of Willa Stein because we see all of her attributes in this row. So now we know spreadsheets let you do lots of things with data. You can store and organize data like we've done in this spreadsheet. But you can go even further and recognize existing data too. Here, I'll show you how. Let's say we want to organize our data by how many siblings each person has. There's a simple way to do that. First, we'll need to select all of our columns with data so that all of it is reorganized together. Then we can go to our data menu. Here we have some options. Let's select sort range. This will let us choose how to organize the column.

Play video starting at :6:39 and follow transcript6:39

Next, we'll choose A to Z, which will organize our numbers in order from smallest to largest. Now, we want to watch out for header row, which is the word siblings, the attribute for this column. We'll check this box. This makes sure the word siblings stays in place. Now we're ready to sort. Voila, we just reorganized our data by sorting it from the smallest number to the largest. As we go further, you discover lots of other ways to work with data in a spreadsheet, including functions and formulas. Let's finish with a quick example of a formula. You can think of formulas as one way of manipulating data in a spreadsheet. Formulas are like a calculator, but more powerful. A formula is a set of instructions that performs a specific action using the data in a spreadsheet. To do this, the formula uses cell references for the values it's calculating. Let me show you. Here we go. We'll click in the next cell in the siblings column. Then we'll type an equal sign. All formulas begin with this symbol. Next, we'll type in the cells we want to add together. In this case, we'll type in C2 plus C3 plus C4. Now we can press "Enter". There it is. The formula has given us the total number of siblings represented in this dataset. We've just analyzed some data. We'll want to store the data for later use. In Google sheets, a spreadsheet is automatically saved in your Google Drive. For Excel and other spreadsheets, you'll save them as a file.

## **Working with spreadsheets**

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/ympZ9aPRSumqWfWj0RrpvQ_d19c5629b02147f388dbbf641b168941_line-y.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=HB-G5gNa1T7mfLx_OZqgl888xZvykLYfdRN9JiUb5VI](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/ympZ9aPRSumqWfWj0RrpvQ_d19c5629b02147f388dbbf641b168941_line-y.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=HB-G5gNa1T7mfLx_OZqgl888xZvykLYfdRN9JiUb5VI)

### **Step 1: Open a spreadsheet**

Open your spreadsheet in Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel.

### **Step 2: Familiarize yourself with the spreadsheet**

If you are already familiar with spreadsheets, that’s great! If spreadsheets are new to you, don’t worry—they are just like the table you created in a previous activity.

To get familiar with spreadsheets, you should consider a spreadsheet’s format:

- Each rectangular block is a **cell**.
- Each cell is meant for one data point, just like in the table you created previously.

Now, consider the cells that run across the top of the spreadsheet (horizontally) and along the left side of the spreadsheet (vertically):

- Cells are organized by columns and rows.
- Each column has a distinct letter, and each row has a distinct number.
- Each cell has a unique identifier composed of the column letter and row number. This identifier is like the cell’s address.

You also have a chart embedded in the spreadsheet. However, the chart is blank, because it doesn’t have any data yet. Next, you will add data!

### **Step 3: Add your data**

Now, you can add your own data from previous learning logs to the spreadsheet. Notice that cell A1 contains the label “Date”, and cell B1 contains the label “Value”.

This lines up with the same structure you used in the table you created in a previous learning log entry, where you recorded data from your daily life. Just like your table, all the “date” parts of your data points go in the cells in column A, and the values you recorded on those dates go in the corresponding cells in column B. It should display like this:

| Date | Value |
| --- | --- |
| 10/19 | 2.5 |
| 10/20 | 2 |
| 10/21 | 1 |
| 10/22 | 1.5 |
| 10/23 | 1.5 |

Next, take all of the data that you previously recorded in your learning log and use it to populate the spreadsheet in the appropriate columns: Add the dates in column A, and the values in column B.

Once you finish adding your data to the spreadsheet, your table will display like this:

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/e8L-TxGsTjSC_k8RrB40QQ_7a763252dda44ce08bc742a4faff6f71_image1.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=4le8MH_rzFLQDoKZLK2cciPMVDF0a8t_V7_PtGAcI9g](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/e8L-TxGsTjSC_k8RrB40QQ_7a763252dda44ce08bc742a4faff6f71_image1.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=4le8MH_rzFLQDoKZLK2cciPMVDF0a8t_V7_PtGAcI9g)

## **Displaying a chart in a spreadsheet**

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/ympZ9aPRSumqWfWj0RrpvQ_d19c5629b02147f388dbbf641b168941_line-y.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=HB-G5gNa1T7mfLx_OZqgl888xZvykLYfdRN9JiUb5VI](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/ympZ9aPRSumqWfWj0RrpvQ_d19c5629b02147f388dbbf641b168941_line-y.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=HB-G5gNa1T7mfLx_OZqgl888xZvykLYfdRN9JiUb5VI)

Next, you will update the chart in your spreadsheet based on the data you entered.

### **Step 4: Reviewing your chart**

Now that you’ve entered your data into the Date and Value columns, your spreadsheet should display like this:

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/0FqpLpTJRMiaqS6UyQTIdA_1e2b80133e0c43df81e1ff6761b37134_pasted-image-0.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=8rZbK0Gm0FRFQmJzD51vkkTrAkut-DZ4I5Pvf62RRfk](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/0FqpLpTJRMiaqS6UyQTIdA_1e2b80133e0c43df81e1ff6761b37134_pasted-image-0.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=8rZbK0Gm0FRFQmJzD51vkkTrAkut-DZ4I5Pvf62RRfk)

Did you notice what happened to the chart when you entered the data in the spreadsheet? The spreadsheet **visualized** the data for you by making it into a basic bar chart. There are many different ways to customize charts, but first you need to clean up your chart. Then, you can interpret the data visualization!

### **Step 5: Cleaning up your chart**

Now that you have a chart, it’s time to clean it up. It’s generally a good idea to tidy your chart by making it descriptive and aesthetically pleasing. Keep in mind that good data analysts are data storytellers!

To change the title of your chart, double click on the chart. You should find that a “Chart Editor” menu displays on the side of your screen. Click on “Chart & axis titles”, and then enter the name of your chart in the “Title Text” box:

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/4PBDUnTWQUywQ1J01tFMPw_3a77f59ef99e489c828df9f8ad1eca49_pasted-image-0.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=N1vajxglwYdAB4BuBWz6XKUx_RxLYCrI05d_sPBuxB4](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/4PBDUnTWQUywQ1J01tFMPw_3a77f59ef99e489c828df9f8ad1eca49_pasted-image-0.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=N1vajxglwYdAB4BuBWz6XKUx_RxLYCrI05d_sPBuxB4)

If you’re using Microsoft Excel, you can double click on the title in the chart to edit directly.

## **SQL in action:**

SQL can do lots of the same things with data that spreadsheets can do. You can use it to store, organize and analyze your data, among other things. But like any good sequel, it's on a larger scale, bigger, more action-packed. Think of it as supersize spreadsheets. For example, you might want to consider a spreadsheet when you have a smaller dataset, such as one with just 100 rows. But if your data set seems to go on forever, and your spreadsheet is struggling to keep up, SQL would be the way to go. When you use SQL, you need a place where the SQL language is understood. If you've ever gone somewhere and not known the language, it can be challenging to communicate. You might think you're asking for one thing and get something completely different. Well, SQL knows the feeling. SQL needs a database that will understand its language. Let's talk. There are a number of databases out there that use SQL. You may use several of them during your time as a data analyst. But here's the thing, no matter which database you use, SQL basically works for the same in each. For example, in SQL, queries are universal. We've talked about queries before, but it never hurts to have a refresher. A query is a request for data or information from a database. Here's the structure of a basic query. You can see that with this query we can select specific data from a table by adding where we can filter the data based on certain conditions. Let's get started. We'll open our database and see how SQL can communicate with it to do some simple data task. First, let's select our dataset. We'll use an asterisk to select all of the data from the table. With that simple query, the database calls up the table we need.

Let's add Where to our query to show how that changes what data we get.

You can see the data now only shows, movies that are in the action genre. That's it, a basic query in SQL

# SQL Guide: Getting started

Just as humans use different languages to communicate with others, so do computers. **Structured Query Language** (or **SQL**, often pronounced “sequel”) enables data analysts to talk to their databases. SQL is one of the most useful data analyst tools, especially when working with large datasets in tables. It can help you investigate huge databases, track down text (referred to as strings) and numbers, and filter for the exact kind of data you need—much faster than a spreadsheet can.

## **What is a query?**

A **query** is a request for data or information from a database. When you query databases, you use SQL to communicate your question or request. You and the database can always exchange information as long as you speak the same language.

Every programming language, including SQL, follows a unique set of guidelines known as **syntax**. **Syntax** is the predetermined structure of a language that includes all required words, symbols, and punctuation, as well as their proper placement. As soon as you enter your search criteria using the correct syntax, the query starts working to pull the data you’ve requested from the target database.

The syntax of every SQL query is the same:

- Use **SELECT** to choose the columns you want to return.
- Use **FROM** to choose the tables where the columns you want are located.
- Use **WHERE** to filter for certain information.

A SQL query is like filling in a template. You will find that if you are writing a SQL query from scratch, it is helpful to start a query by writing the SELECT, FROM, and WHERE keywords in the following format:

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/MwhC5HMJRFKIQuRzCURSDw_754b0ed1d87441a298173d87c0bfdbf1_Select_From_Where.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=YMc2AmJpK0aVFrg35X9xJYzm7O0fbOO_vkk6ZD4gsIQ](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/MwhC5HMJRFKIQuRzCURSDw_754b0ed1d87441a298173d87c0bfdbf1_Select_From_Where.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=YMc2AmJpK0aVFrg35X9xJYzm7O0fbOO_vkk6ZD4gsIQ)

Next, enter the table name after the FROM; the table columns you want after the SELECT; and, finally, the conditions you want to place on your query after the WHERE. Make sure to add a new line and indent when adding these, as shown below:

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/tATEidLdSU2ExInS3XlNog_a8c8eba2320243f59e18258430049353_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.23.52-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=ejUXQCFgfSJmNcqPs1mOkNG3FUjsnCl69WZygTcZHLA](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/tATEidLdSU2ExInS3XlNog_a8c8eba2320243f59e18258430049353_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.23.52-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=ejUXQCFgfSJmNcqPs1mOkNG3FUjsnCl69WZygTcZHLA)

Following this method each time makes it easier to write SQL queries. It can also help you make fewer syntax errors.

### **Example of a query**

Here is how a simple query would appear in BigQuery, a data warehouse on the Google Cloud Platform.

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/vNz9GfCMQiGc_RnwjMIhfQ_1d09943b48924e6cbf9915e30f771d86_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.25.17-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=Wv6tBkL67ul9cJ-lpG4Zodz8IZzqW2nnk2jXlP4QGdY](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/vNz9GfCMQiGc_RnwjMIhfQ_1d09943b48924e6cbf9915e30f771d86_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.25.17-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=Wv6tBkL67ul9cJ-lpG4Zodz8IZzqW2nnk2jXlP4QGdY)

The above query uses three commands to locate customers with the first name Tony:

1. **SELECT** the column named **first_name**
2. **FROM** a table named **customer_name** (in a dataset named **customer_data**)
(The dataset name is always followed by a dot, and then the table name.)
3. But only return the data **WHERE** the first_name is **Tony**

The results from the query might be similar to the following:

**first_name**

---

Tony

---

Tony

---

Tony

---

As you can conclude, this query had the correct syntax, but wasn't very useful after the data was returned.

## **Multiple columns in a query**

In real life, you will need to work with more data beyond customers named Tony. Multiple columns that are chosen by the same SELECT command can be indented and grouped together.

If you are requesting multiple data fields from a table, you need to include these columns in your SELECT command. Each column is separated by a comma as shown below:

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/wOQ23bcrTeakNt23K23myw_8351721c783f4528a58b44435e8e8650_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.26.17-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=RZyy6ybA0n-uFOO9UuApiD9nWbTd17HQMIi27mquxIo](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/wOQ23bcrTeakNt23K23myw_8351721c783f4528a58b44435e8e8650_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.26.17-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=RZyy6ybA0n-uFOO9UuApiD9nWbTd17HQMIi27mquxIo)

Here is an example of how it would appear in BigQuery:

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/-kywAm5gQTOMsAJuYEEzSA_2dab01a4a07d4ad386cb1f56d7e3b8b6_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.27.02-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=N5flm0OvWtB6ue_ewca49hx5XVi0bwAqP0FrWfKPsHI](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/-kywAm5gQTOMsAJuYEEzSA_2dab01a4a07d4ad386cb1f56d7e3b8b6_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.27.02-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=N5flm0OvWtB6ue_ewca49hx5XVi0bwAqP0FrWfKPsHI)

The above query uses three commands to locate customers with the first name Tony.

1. **SELECT** the columns named **customer_id**, **first_name**, and **last_name**
2. **FROM** a table named **customer_name** (in a dataset named **customer_data**)
(The dataset name is always followed by a dot, and then the table name.)
3. But only return the data **WHERE** the first_name is **Tony**

The only difference between this query and the previous one is that more data columns are selected. The previous query selected first_name only while this query selects customer_id and last_name in addition to first_name. In general, it is a more efficient use of resources to select only the columns that you need. For example, it makes sense to select more columns if you will actually use the additional fields in your WHERE clause. If you have multiple conditions in your WHERE clause, they may be written like this:

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/kUL18th9QOqC9fLYfeDqEw_eb2d08d4837d44ef99de7c61179418bd_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.27.47-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=woBIFHYsDjjUdSgxPhuZwTNWqsqfOuWkbLO6vmvlwfg](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/kUL18th9QOqC9fLYfeDqEw_eb2d08d4837d44ef99de7c61179418bd_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.27.47-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=woBIFHYsDjjUdSgxPhuZwTNWqsqfOuWkbLO6vmvlwfg)

Notice that unlike the SELECT command that uses a comma to separate fields/variables/parameters, the WHERE command uses the AND statement to connect conditions. As you become a more advanced writer of queries, you will make use of other connectors/operators such as OR and NOT.

Here is a BigQuery example with multiple fields used in a WHERE clause:

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/ecPw3J_NQcmD8NyfzRHJUw_5120dcd87b99400cb7f4a9014439ee18_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.29.06-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=sauEWy1egTgf5_XKDTzrOwaEutm_wLUjSO5LJceOu4s](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/ecPw3J_NQcmD8NyfzRHJUw_5120dcd87b99400cb7f4a9014439ee18_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.29.06-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=sauEWy1egTgf5_XKDTzrOwaEutm_wLUjSO5LJceOu4s)

The above query uses three commands to locate customers with a valid (greater than 0) customer ID whose first name is Tony and last name is Magnolia.

1. **SELECT** the columns named **customer_id**, **first_name**, and **last_name**
2. **FROM** a table named **customer_name** (in a dataset named **customer_data**)
(The dataset name is always followed by a dot, and then the table name.)
3. But only return the data **WHERE** customer_id is greater than **0**, first_name is **Tony**, and last_name is **Magnolia**.

Note that one of the conditions is a logical condition that checks to see if customer_id is greater than zero.

If only one customer is named Tony Magnolia, the results from the query could be:

| customer_id | first_name | last_name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1967 | Tony | Magnolia |

If more than one customer has the same name, the results from the query could be:

| customer_id | first_name | last_name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1967 | Tony | Magnolia |
| 7689 | Tony | Magnolia |

## **Key takeaway**

The most important thing to remember is how to use SELECT, FROM, and WHERE in a query. Queries with multiple fields will become simpler after you practice writing your own SQL queries later in the program.

# SQL Guide: Getting started

Just as humans use different languages to communicate with others, so do computers. **Structured Query Language** (or **SQL**, often pronounced “sequel”) enables data analysts to talk to their databases. SQL is one of the most useful data analyst tools, especially when working with large datasets in tables. It can help you investigate huge databases, track down text (referred to as strings) and numbers, and filter for the exact kind of data you need—much faster than a spreadsheet can.

If you haven’t used SQL before, this reading will help you learn the basics so you can appreciate how useful SQL is and how useful SQL queries are in particular. You will be writing SQL queries in no time at all.

## **What is a query?**

A **query** is a request for data or information from a database. When you query databases, you use SQL to communicate your question or request. You and the database can always exchange information as long as you speak the same language.

Next, enter the table name after the FROM; the table columns you want after the SELECT; and, finally, the conditions you want to place on your query after the WHERE. Make sure to add a new line and indent when adding these, as shown below:

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/tATEidLdSU2ExInS3XlNog_a8c8eba2320243f59e18258430049353_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.23.52-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=ejUXQCFgfSJmNcqPs1mOkNG3FUjsnCl69WZygTcZHLA](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/tATEidLdSU2ExInS3XlNog_a8c8eba2320243f59e18258430049353_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.23.52-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=ejUXQCFgfSJmNcqPs1mOkNG3FUjsnCl69WZygTcZHLA)

Following this method each time makes it easier to write SQL queries. It can also help you make fewer syntax errors.

### **Example of a query**

Here is how a simple query would appear in BigQuery, a data warehouse on the Google Cloud Platform.

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/vNz9GfCMQiGc_RnwjMIhfQ_1d09943b48924e6cbf9915e30f771d86_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.25.17-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=Wv6tBkL67ul9cJ-lpG4Zodz8IZzqW2nnk2jXlP4QGdY](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/vNz9GfCMQiGc_RnwjMIhfQ_1d09943b48924e6cbf9915e30f771d86_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.25.17-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=Wv6tBkL67ul9cJ-lpG4Zodz8IZzqW2nnk2jXlP4QGdY)

The above query uses three commands to locate customers with the first name Tony:

1. **SELECT** the column named **first_name**
2. **FROM** a table named **customer_name** (in a dataset named **customer_data**)
(The dataset name is always followed by a dot, and then the table name.)
3. But only return the data **WHERE** the first_name is **Tony**

The results from the query might be similar to the following:

**first_name**

---

Tony

---

Tony

---

Tony

---

As you can conclude, this query had the correct syntax, but wasn't very useful after the data was returned.

## **Multiple columns in a query**

In real life, you will need to work with more data beyond customers named Tony. Multiple columns that are chosen by the same SELECT command can be indented and grouped together.

If you are requesting multiple data fields from a table, you need to include these columns in your SELECT command. Each column is separated by a comma as shown below:

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/wOQ23bcrTeakNt23K23myw_8351721c783f4528a58b44435e8e8650_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.26.17-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=RZyy6ybA0n-uFOO9UuApiD9nWbTd17HQMIi27mquxIo](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/wOQ23bcrTeakNt23K23myw_8351721c783f4528a58b44435e8e8650_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.26.17-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=RZyy6ybA0n-uFOO9UuApiD9nWbTd17HQMIi27mquxIo)

Here is an example of how it would appear in BigQuery:

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/-kywAm5gQTOMsAJuYEEzSA_2dab01a4a07d4ad386cb1f56d7e3b8b6_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.27.02-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=N5flm0OvWtB6ue_ewca49hx5XVi0bwAqP0FrWfKPsHI](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/-kywAm5gQTOMsAJuYEEzSA_2dab01a4a07d4ad386cb1f56d7e3b8b6_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.27.02-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=N5flm0OvWtB6ue_ewca49hx5XVi0bwAqP0FrWfKPsHI)

The above query uses three commands to locate customers with the first name Tony.

1. **SELECT** the columns named **customer_id**, **first_name**, and **last_name**
2. **FROM** a table named **customer_name** (in a dataset named **customer_data**)
(The dataset name is always followed by a dot, and then the table name.)
3. But only return the data **WHERE** the first_name is **Tony**

The only difference between this query and the previous one is that more data columns are selected. The previous query selected first_name only while this query selects customer_id and last_name in addition to first_name. In general, it is a more efficient use of resources to select only the columns that you need. For example, it makes sense to select more columns if you will actually use the additional fields in your WHERE clause. If you have multiple conditions in your WHERE clause, they may be written like this:

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/kUL18th9QOqC9fLYfeDqEw_eb2d08d4837d44ef99de7c61179418bd_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.27.47-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=woBIFHYsDjjUdSgxPhuZwTNWqsqfOuWkbLO6vmvlwfg](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/kUL18th9QOqC9fLYfeDqEw_eb2d08d4837d44ef99de7c61179418bd_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.27.47-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=woBIFHYsDjjUdSgxPhuZwTNWqsqfOuWkbLO6vmvlwfg)

Notice that unlike the SELECT command that uses a comma to separate fields/variables/parameters, the WHERE command uses the AND statement to connect conditions. As you become a more advanced writer of queries, you will make use of other connectors/operators such as OR and NOT.

Here is a BigQuery example with multiple fields used in a WHERE clause:

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/ecPw3J_NQcmD8NyfzRHJUw_5120dcd87b99400cb7f4a9014439ee18_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.29.06-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=sauEWy1egTgf5_XKDTzrOwaEutm_wLUjSO5LJceOu4s](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/ecPw3J_NQcmD8NyfzRHJUw_5120dcd87b99400cb7f4a9014439ee18_Screen-Shot-2020-11-11-at-4.29.06-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=sauEWy1egTgf5_XKDTzrOwaEutm_wLUjSO5LJceOu4s)

The above query uses three commands to locate customers with a valid (greater than 0) customer ID whose first name is Tony and last name is Magnolia.

1. **SELECT** the columns named **customer_id**, **first_name**, and **last_name**
2. **FROM** a table named **customer_name** (in a dataset named **customer_data**)
(The dataset name is always followed by a dot, and then the table name.)
3. But only return the data **WHERE** customer_id is greater than **0**, first_name is **Tony**, and last_name is **Magnolia**.

Note that one of the conditions is a logical condition that checks to see if customer_id is greater than zero.

If only one customer is named Tony Magnolia, the results from the query could be:

| customer_id | first_name | last_name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1967 | Tony | Magnolia |

If more than one customer has the same name, the results from the query could be:

| customer_id | first_name | last_name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1967 | Tony | Magnolia |
| 7689 | Tony | Magnolia |

## **Key takeaway**

The most important thing to remember is how to use SELECT, FROM, and WHERE in a query. Queries with multiple fields will become simpler after you practice writing your own SQL queries later in the program.

# **SQL Cheat Sheet**

## Starter guide for standard SQL syntax used in PostgreSQL:

SQL is the most important coding language to learn for data analysis. Some might argue Python and R are equally important, but when it comes to the most common tool an Analyst must have it is SQL.

According to [Dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/why-sql-is-the-most-important-language-to-learn/) almost all of the biggest names in tech use SQL. Uber, Netflix, Airbnb — the list goes on. Even within companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon, which have built their own high-performance database systems, data teams use SQL to query data and perform analysis.

Like every language, you need to keep practicing to understand and grasp keep concepts. In my opinion, SQL is one of the easier languages to use once you understand the basic structure of the code. In this article, I share the necessary steps to getting started with SQL querying.

# **Standard SQL Structure**

This is **Part 1** to a series of PostgreSQL cheat sheets and will cover `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`.

The basic structure of a query pulling results from a single table is as follows.

```
SELECT
	COLUMN_NAME(S)
FROM
	TABLE_NAME
WHERE
	CONDITION
GROUP BY
	COLUMN_NAME(S)
HAVING
	AGGREGATE_CONDITION
ORDER BY
	COLUMN_NAME
LIMIT
	N
```

# **What is SQL?**

[SQL](http://www.sqlcourse.com/intro.html) (pronounced “ess-que-el”) stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. It is the standard language for relational database management systems. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database or retrieve data from a database.

# **What is Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)?**

An [RDBMS](https://www.predictiveanalyticstoday.com/top-free-relational-database-management-system-rdbms/) organizes data into tables with rows and columns. The term relational means that values within each table have a relationship with each other.

- Rows — also known as records
- Columns — also known as fields, have a descriptive name and specific data type.

# **What is PostgreSQL?**

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/what-is-postgresql/) is a general-purpose and relational database management system, the most advanced open-source database system.

Other common database management systems are MySQL, Oracle, IBM Db2, and MS Access.

Let’s begin!

# **SELECT**

The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database. The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.

## **Specific columns**

```
SELECT
	COLUMN_1,
	COLUMN_2
FROM
	TABLE_NAME
```

## **All columns**

Using the `*` you can query every column in your table

```
SELECT *
FROM
	TABLE_NAME
```

## **DISTINCT Columns**

Finding all the unique records in a column

```
SELECT
	DISTINCT(COLUMN_NAME)
FROM
	TABLE_NAME
```

## **COUNT all rows**

If you want to know all the values in the entire table use `COUNT(*)` you will get a single number.

```
SELECT
	COUNT(*)
FROM
	TABLE_NAME
```

## **COUNT DISTINCT values**

If you want the number of distinct values in a column using `COUNT` with `DISTINCT` and you will get a number representing the total unique values of a column

```
SELECT
	COUNT (DISTINCT COLUMN_NAME)
FROM
	TABLE_NAME
```

# **WHERE**

Using the `WHERE` the clause, you can create conditions to filter out values you want or don't want.

NOTE — `WHERE` is always used before a `GROUP BY` (More on this later)

```
SELECT *
FROM
	TABLE_NAME
WHERE
	CONDITION
```

## **Conditions**

There are a variety of conditions that can be used in SQL. Below are some examples of a table that consists of students’ grades in school. You only need to specify `WHERE` once, for the sake of the example, I have included `WHERE` in each step.

```
WHERE FIRSTNAME      = 'BOB'      -- exact match
WHERE FIRSTNAME     != 'BOB'     -- everything excluding BOB
WHERE NOT FIRSTNAME  ='BOB'    -- everything excluding BOBWHERE FIRSTNAME IN ('BOB', 'JASON')       -- either condition is met
WHERE FIRSTNAME NOT IN ('BOB', 'JASON')   -- excludes both valuesWHERE FIRSTNAME = 'BOB' AND LASTNAME = 'SMITH'  -- both conditions
WHERE FIRSTNAME = 'BOB' OR FIRSTNAME = 'JASON'  -- either conditionWHERE GRADES > 90           -- greater than 90
WHERE GRADES < 90           -- less than 90
WHERE GRADES  >= 90         -- greater than or equal to 90
WHERE GRADES  <= 90         -- less than or equal to 90WHERE SUBJECT IS NULL       -- returns values with missing values
WHERE SUBJECT NOT NULL      -- returns values with no missing values
```

## **Conditions — Wildcards**

`LIKE` operator is used in a `WHERE` clause to search for a specified pattern in a column. When you pass the `LIKE` operator in the `''` upper and lower case matters.

There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the `LIKE` operator:

- `%` - The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters
- `_` - The underscore represents a single character

```
WHERE FIRSTNAME LIKE ‘B%’ -- finds values starting uppercase BWHERE FIRSTNAME LIKE ‘%b’ -- finds values ending lowercase bWHERE FIRSTNAME LIKE ‘%an%’ -- find values that have “an” in any positionWHERE FIRSTNAME LIKE ‘_n%’ -- find values that have “n” in the second positionWHERE FIRSTNAME LIKE ‘B__%’ -- find values that start with “B” and have at least 3 characters in lengthWHERE FIRSTNAME LIKE ‘B%b’ -- find values that start with “B” and end with “b”WHERE FIRSTNAME LIKE ‘[BFL]’ -- find all values that start with ‘B’, ‘F’ OR ‘L’WHERE FIRSTNAME LIKE ‘[B-D]’ -- find all values that start with ‘B’, ‘C’, OR ‘D’WHERE FIRSTNAME LIKE ‘[!BFL]%’ -- find everything exlcusing values that start with ‘B’, ‘F’ OR ‘L’WHERE FIRSTNAME NOT LIKE ‘[BFL]%’ -- same as above. excludes values starting with ‘B’, ‘F’, OR ‘L’WHERE GRADES BETWEEN 80 and 90 -- find grades between 80 and 90
```

# **GROUP BY**

The `GROUP BY` function helps calculate summary values by the chosen column. It is often used with aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`).

```
SELECT
	SUBJECT,
	AVG(GRADES)
FROM
	STUDENTS
GROUP BY
	SUBJECT
```

The query above will group each subject and calculate the **average** grades.

```
SELECT
	SUBJECT,
	COUNT(*)
FROM
	STUDENTS
GROUP BY
	SUBJECT
```

The above query will calculate the **number** (count) of students in each subject.

# **HAVING**

The `HAVING` clause is similar to `WHERE` but is catered for **filtering aggregate functions**. The `HAVING` function comes after the `GROUP BY`, in comparison the `WHERE` comes before the `GROUP BY`.

If we wanted to find which subject had an average grade of 90 or more, we could use the following.

```
SELECT
	SUBJECT,
	AVG(GRADES)
FROM
	STUDENTS
GROUP BY
	SUBJECT
HAVING
	AVG(GRADES) >= 90
```

# **ORDER BY**

Using the `ORDER BY` function, you can specify how you want your values sorted. Continuing with the Student tables from earlier.

```
SELECT
	*
FROM
	STUDENTS
ORDER BY
	GRADES DESC
```

When using the `ORDER BY` by default, the sort will be in **ascending** order. If you want to descend, you need to specify `DESC` after the column name.

# **LIMIT**

In Postgres, we can use the `LIMIT` function to control how many rows are outputted in the query. For example, if we wanted to find the top 3 students with the highest grades.

```
SELECT
	*
FROM
	STUDENTS
ORDER BY
	GRADES DESC
LIMIT
	3
```

Since we use `ORDER BY DESC` we have the order of students with the highest grades on top - now limiting it to 3 values, we see the **top 3**.

## **Becoming a data viz whiz:**

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information. For tons of data analysts, it's the most exciting part of their job because they get to see their hard work pay off with something interesting. Not to mention that data visualization is beautiful and useful. I was floored when I got to Google and started to get a quarterly data report in my e-mail and had a big slide deck where people contributed their visualizations. It was definitely a source of light as I started to build my own visualizations. If you're not impressed by my story, let me tell you about Florence Nightingale. Does that name ring a bell? She is responsible for much of the philosophy of modern nursing, and believe it or not, she was also a data analyst. During the Crimean War in the 1850s, thousands of soldiers were dying every day, Nightingale wanted to find a way to reduce the number of deaths. After examining the data, she found that the majority of soldiers were dying from preventable conditions. To convince hospital administrators that they needed to focus on these conditions, she created a chart showing the number of deaths over several months. The much larger blue sections in the visualization represent the preventable deaths. Her work directly led to major changes in patient care. She did all of this over 150 years ago without a computer. One of the main reasons Nightingale created this visualization was to make the data easier to digest for her audience. She felt she'd be more successful convincing the stakeholders using visuals instead of just words and numbers. She was right, tables filled with data, while necessary for analysis, just aren't able to show trends and patterns as quickly and clearly as visualizations can. Imagine, you receive an assignment that needs to be completed the same day. You gather the data you need in a table, could you explain your findings using the table? Yes, you probably could, but a better idea will be to use a visualization like this bar graph. Something like this makes it much easier for you to explain quickly, and you've got the benefit of a cool graphic to backup your analysis. As a data analyst, you'll want to create visualizations that make the data easy to understand, and interesting to look at, so show it off. Stakeholders may not have much time to devote to the data, your job will be to make their time worthwhile. Let's go back to that data table we created earlier in the course. If you created your own for practice, you can open it up now or try this out later. Here's the data we added before. Let's create a visualization of the data by inserting a chart, a bar graph. You can see that the spreadsheet visualized the data from our table in a way that made the most sense. It created a bar graph or column chart to compare the ages of each person by name, but you might have figured that out already. That's the beauty of visualization, it shows data analysis quickly and clearly. We can use chart editor to adjust the chart. Different spreadsheet programs might have different ways to do this, but they all have visualization functions and ways to edit those visualizations. For now, let's just look at the suggested charts. We can make the bars go horizontally using a bar chart. That looks great, so let's close the Chart editor. There are lots of options to look at, but we'll keep it basic for now. Feel free to try other visualizations if you practice later. Now, we can adjust our chart to make our whole spreadsheet look clean and professional. Excellent. I hope you learn to love data visualization as much as I do. Maybe you'll become a data visualization pioneer, just like Florence Nightingale. As a budding data analysts, you started to fill your utility belt with valuable tools that you'll use throughout the rest of the program. Having spreadsheets, SQL and data visualization know-how will help make you an ace data detective. You'll be able to use these tools throughout the data analytics process as you move forward.

# Planning a data visualization

Earlier, you learned that **data visualization** is the graphical representation of information. As a data analyst, you will want to create visualizations that make your data easy to understand and interesting to look at. Because of the importance of data visualization, most data analytics tools (such as spreadsheets and databases) have a built-in visualization component while others (such as Tableau) specialize in visualization as their primary value-add. In this reading, you will explore the steps involved in the data visualization process and a few of the most common data visualization tools available.

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_VNeIHMYSNKTXiBzGPjSOA_1658b4bf2f744c5ea5c926fbbf5b05f2_Screen-Shot-2021-03-03-at-3.28.48-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=eX9c_DGsUW4K0SlCVmymY_8xaUPVRNNlV1rK1r-XuaE](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_VNeIHMYSNKTXiBzGPjSOA_1658b4bf2f744c5ea5c926fbbf5b05f2_Screen-Shot-2021-03-03-at-3.28.48-PM.png?expiry=1681344000000&hmac=eX9c_DGsUW4K0SlCVmymY_8xaUPVRNNlV1rK1r-XuaE)

## **Steps to plan a data visualization**

Let’s go through an example of a real-life situation where a data analyst might need to create a data visualization to share with stakeholders. Imagine you’re a data analyst for a clothing distributor. The company helps small clothing stores manage their inventory, and sales are booming. One day, you learn that your company is getting ready to make a major update to its website. To guide decisions for the website update, you’re asked to analyze data from the existing website and sales records. Let’s go through the steps you might follow.

### **Step 1: Explore the data for patterns**

First, you ask your manager or the data owner for access to the current sales records and website analytics reports. This includes information about how customers behave on the company’s existing website, basic information about who visited, who bought from the company, and how much they bought.

While reviewing the data you notice a pattern among those who visit the company’s website most frequently: geography and larger amounts spent on purchases. With further analysis, this information might explain why sales are so strong right now in the northeast—and help your company find ways to make them even stronger through the new website.

### **Step 2: Plan your visuals**

Next it is time to refine the data and present the results of your analysis. Right now, you have a lot of data spread across several different tables, which isn’t an ideal way to share your results with management and the marketing team. You will want to create a data visualization that explains your findings quickly and effectively to your target audience. Since you know your audience is sales oriented, you already know that the data visualization you use should:

- Show sales numbers over time
- Connect sales to location
- Show the relationship between sales and website use
- Show which customers fuel growth

### **Step 3: Create your visuals**

Now that you have decided what kind of information and insights you want to display, it is time to start creating the actual visualizations. Keep in mind that creating the right visualization for a presentation or to share with stakeholders is a process. It involves trying different visualization formats and making adjustments until you get what you are looking for. In this case, a mix of different visuals will best communicate your findings and turn your analysis into the most compelling story for stakeholders. So, you can use the built-in chart capabilities in your spreadsheets to organize the data and create your visuals.

1) line charts can track sales over time
2) maps can connect sales to locations
3) donut charts can show customer segments
4) bar charts can compare total visitors that make a purchase

## **Build your data visualization toolkit**

There are many different tools you can use for data visualization.

- You can use the visualizations tools in your spreadsheet to create simple visualizations such as line and bar charts.
- You can use more advanced tools such as Tableau that allow you to integrate data into dashboard-style visualizations.
- If you’re working with the programming language R you can use the visualization tools in RStudio.

Your choice of visualization will be driven by a variety of drivers including the size of your data, the process you used for analyzing your data (spreadsheet, or databases/queries, or programming languages). For now, just consider the basics.

## **Spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets)**

In our example, the built-in charts and graphs in spreadsheets made the process of creating visuals quick and easy. Spreadsheets are great for creating simple visualizations like bar graphs and pie charts, and even provide some advanced visualizations like maps, and waterfall and funnel diagrams (shown in the following figures).

But sometimes you need a more powerful tool to truly bring your data to life. Tableau and RStudio are two examples of widely used platforms that can help you plan, create, and present effective and compelling data visualizations.

## **Visualization software (Tableau)**

Tableau is a popular data visualization tool that lets you pull data from nearly any system and turn it into compelling visuals or actionable insights. The platform offers built-in visual best practices, which makes analyzing and sharing data fast, easy, and (most importantly) useful. Tableau works well with a wide variety of data and includes an interactive dashboard that lets you and your stakeholders click to explore the data interactively.

## **Programming language (R with RStudio)**

A lot of data analysts work with a programming language called R. Most people who work with R end up also using RStudio, an integrated developer environment (IDE), for their data visualization needs. As with Tableau, you can create dashboard-style data visualizations using RStudio.

# The job of a data analyst

Previously, we learned about what a data analyst does and why that work is so valuable. Now, let's look at where data analysts actually do their work. You'll learn much more about the industries you could work in as a data analyst. And how companies in these fields are already using data analytics to do some really cool things. There are so many businesses out there that have a big need for the skills you're learning right now. Across industries like technology, marketing, finance, health care, and so many more. Real companies are already using data analytics to stay ahead of the curve. And the more they use data in their business, the more they understand just how important data analyst like you are to their success. Let's look at a real life example of a brand you'll probably recognize, Coca-Cola. Data is changing the way Coca-Cola approaches its marketing strategies. Coca-Cola uses data gathered from consumer feedback to create advertising that speaks directly to different audiences with different interests. How does this work? You know those high tech Coca-Cola vending machines you see at movie theater sometimes? It's always fun getting to make your own flavors. Well, those machines have built-in artificial intelligence and data analysis tools. This helps Coca-Cola see all the different kinds of flavor combinations people are coming up with, which they can then use as inspiration for new products. How cool is that? Ever wonder how Google gives you the right answer to any question in just seconds? That's powered by data too. We use all kinds of data to determine a website's reliability and accuracy to make sure you get the most useful results for any search you make. But it isn't just big companies like Coca-Cola and Google that use data. Small businesses everywhere are also starting to take advantage of data driven insights to improve their operations and make better decisions. Small businesses can use data to do all kinds of things. They might use data analytics to better understand their customers' buying habits, create more effective social media messaging, or, in the case of one city zoo and aquarium, predict the number of daily visitors based on local climate data. City zoo and aquarium realized that, on rainy days, they were seeing huge drop offs in attendance, but they had no way to accurately predict when those rainy days would hit. This made staffing a real challenge. Some days they found themselves overstaffed, other days they were unprepared for the rush of visitors. To deal with this, data analyst took years of weather records from the zoo and use that data to accurately predict future weather patterns. This made it easy for the zoo to know how much staff they needed when. Because the zoo could predict and manage their staffing needs more accurately, they were able to provide a better experience for visitors and dedicate more resources to creating a better experience for the animals too. We see a similar thing in the healthcare industry. Their data analysts look at clinic attendance data to help hospitals and doctors offices predict when rush hours will hit so they can be ready for it. Your local city hospital is a great example. Let's say they've been getting complaints about long wait times. Sometimes an hour or more, which made it hard for some patients to get the care they needed. So data analyst use data about the hospitals daily foot traffic to help them make more informed decisions about how many doctors they need on staff at any given time. This helped reduce wait times, improve their patients experience, and make better use of the health care worker's time too. Like I said, there are many ways that companies in different industries put data to use, but they can only do that if they have data analyst they can rely on. So you might be wondering, how you fit into the equation? Well, you've got plenty of options, but you don't have to decide what industry you want to work in right away. There will be plenty of time to think about that as you make your way through this program. By the time you finish this program, you have the core skills that will make you valuable in any industry that makes data driven decisions. Which, as it turns out, is most industries, even zoos. Coming up, we'll check out the business task where data can be helpful.

# Joey: Path to becoming a data analyst

Hi, I'm Joey and I work as an analytics program manager within REWS. Now REWS stands for real estate and workplace services, and my job is to bring data and analytics into the decision-making here, especially with regards to creating a safe and fun work environment. My journey into analytics was a bit different in that I had no plan or really didn't see myself being where I am now. Now luckily, I started in a rotational program called the HRA program within people operations, which afforded me the ability to play three different roles essentially. I was in a generalist capacity in a specialist role and as an analyst, and I really found a love and a passion in the analytical work. I started on the business intelligence team, whose job was to provide SQL-based reporting back to the business. I realized the analytics is the right career path for me when I found myself enjoying coming to work and getting my work done. And I think I can connect that to two passions of mine. The first is problem-solving. I love taking a complex problem, a mystery, a riddle and being able to find the answers and come up with the solution. And then the second thing is being able to work with people and help people. In analytics I feel like the key to success is being able to blend the personal side with the technical side. At the beginning of my career, I focused a little more on the technical pieces, and I wanted to make sure I had the right technical knowledge to be able to answer questions. But what I found is over time I needed to grow that other side just as much. And I think that my career has allowed me those opportunities to kind of work each of those muscles, the human interaction part and the technical part to make sure that they're both growing at the end of the day.

Consider the company, service, or product you chose in this reflection:

- How could it use data to improve customer experience?
- What kinds of data would it need to collect?
- How could insights from that data solve a problem?

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Type your response in the text box below.

**1 / 1 point**

I will visualize it.
Sorted data
They solve problems by offering insights

**Correct**

Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! A good reflection on this topic would consider how a specific kind of data can help a company, product, or service improve its customer service experience.

For example, consider a restaurant that delivers cold food to customers. More data about the delivery process, such as the average delivery time or the average number of daily deliveries, could help the restaurant streamline the process and deliver food on time.

Data analytics helps businesses make better decisions, but getting there is a process. It begins with analyzing a business problem, identifying data about that problem, and then using data analysis to arrive at an answer. Sometimes you get an answer that solves your business problem, but it’s often just as likely that you discover other questions to investigate further.

# Tony: Supporting careers in data analytics

For any analyst, for any person that's honestly at the early stages of their career, understanding data, respecting data and knowing how to work with data is incredibly important because, my vision is that every role in some form or fashion will involve data and its use in learning how to extract insights from it will be at the core of any critical role across any company organization. Generally in those first two years, you are developing the core skill sets that make you a fantastic generalist, and then in the next 2-5 years, you're learning about something very specific as as it relates to your job. Whether it's the area that you're supporting or maybe a very technical component. Like, let's say you want to become a SQL expert so that you can manipulate large data sets for financial analysis purposes. Similarly, even if you come into finance as a data analyst, you can pop out of finance and go into what a lot of people like to call the business, which is typically your Operations Functions and become a business analyst or a data analysts. There's so many different paths that you can take from the starting point that you really can't predict your end. I'm just deeply passionate about working with and supporting young people and really giving them a jumpstart to their career. This stems from honestly my own personal experience, where in the first two years of my career, I had essentially zero support from my manager and my direct management chain. Having gone through that experience my first few years, I realize and I felt experience how that can slow you down, and especially when you are somebody that has a lot of potential and a lot of ability, you want to be in an environment that fosters that ability and really wants to see you grow. I think it's incredibly important to have programs like these that take away all the barriers that remove any of the constructs that prevent people from being able to find out what they need to be in an industry like this, to be successful in a role like a data analyst, so that they themselves can dream about where they can go in their career. My name is Tony. I'm a Finance program manager at Google.

# The power of data in business

As a data analyst, you'll be tackling business tasks that help companies use data. Coming up, we'll talk more about what a business task actually is, and some examples of what they might look like in real data analyst jobs. Let's take a second and think back on the real examples of businesses using data analytics and their operation we've seen before. You might have noticed a common theme across every example. They all have issues to explore, questions to answer, or problems to solve. It's easy for these things to get mixed up. Here's a way to keep them straight when we talk about them in data analytics. An issue is a topic or subject to investigate. A question is designed to discover information and a problem is an obstacle or complication that needs to be worked out. Coca-Cola had a question about new products. Data analysis gave them insights into new flavors customers already like. The City Zoo and Aquarium had a problem with staffing. Data, helped them figure out the best staffing strategy. These questions and problems become the foundation for all kinds of business tasks, that you'll help solve as a data analyst. A business task is the question or problem data analysis answers for business. This is where you focus a lot of your efforts in the work you'll do for future employers. Let's stick with our zoo example and see if we can imagine what a business task for a zoo might look like. We know the problem, unpredictable weather was making it hard for the zoo to anticipate staffing needs. Maybe the business task could be something like, analyze weather data from the last decade to identify predictable patterns. The data analysts could then plan out the best way to gather, analyze, and present the data needed to solve this task and meet the zoos goals. Then, using data, the zoo would be able to make informed decisions about their daily staffing. We talked a little about data-driven decision making in previous videos. But just in case you need a refresher, here it is. Data-driven decision-making is when facts that have been discovered through data analysis are used to guide business strategy. The simplest way to think about decision-making is that it's a choice between consequences, good, bad, or a combination of both. In our zoo example, the zoo had the data they needed to make an informed decision that solved their problem. But what if they had made this decision without data? Let's say they just relied on observation and memory to track the weather and make staffing schedules. Well, we already know that wouldn't have solve their problem long-term. Data analytics gave them the information they needed to find the best possible solution to their problem. That's the power of data. Observation and intuition are powerful tools in decision-making, but they can only take us so far when we make decisions based on just observation and gut feelings, we're only seeing part of the picture. Data helps us see the whole thing. With data, we have a complete picture of the problem and its causes, which lets us find new and surprising solutions we never would've been able to see before. Data analytics helps businesses make better decisions. It all starts with a business task and the question it's trying to answer. With the skills you'll learn throughout this program, you'll be able to ask the right questions, plan out the best way to gather and analyze data, and then present it visually to arm your team so they can make an informed, data-driven decision. That makes you critical to the success of any business you work for. Data is a powerful tool. With great power comes, well, you know the rest. And you're doing a super job taking in all of this information. Up next, we'll talk about your responsibility as a data analyst to make sure you're gathering, analyzing, and presenting data in a way that's fair to the people being represented by that data.

# Rachel: Data detectives

Hi, my name is Rachel, and I'm the Business systems and analytics lead at Verily. There are a lot of different types of problems that a data analyst can solve. I've been lucky enough over my career to have seen a lot of them and to take in a lot of very different types of data and help turn that into meaningful answers. I think one of the most important things to remember about data analytics is that data is data. I'm a finance data analyst and so my role at Verily is to take all of our financial information, all of the information of the money we're spending and the money we're making, and turn that into reports and insights so that our business leads can understand what we're doing. One of the most important things I've done at Verily recently was help create what's called a profit and loss statement for each of our business units. That means that in real time, our teams can see what their budget is and how they're spending against that budget. What that does is that helps our teams keep to that budget by either increasing their revenue streams so that they have more money to play with or pulling back their spending so that they can keep themselves within that budget. All of that really helps keep us on track as a company in making sure that we're hitting our goals. I found that data acts like a living and breathing thing. When you have a ton of data points, it can be overwhelming when you first sit down to make sense of it. You have tons of columns, tons of records, tons of different types of data, and finding a way to make sense of that is really hard and that's where the expertise of a data analyst comes in. It has been some of the most frustrating moments of my career, but also some of the most rewarding work I've ever done when it finally comes together. The best advice I have for any data analyst starting out is keep at it. If the angle you're taking doesn't work, try to find another one. Try to come at it in a different way, try to ask a different question, and eventually the data will yield and you'll get the insights you're looking for.

# Understanding data and fairness

So far, we've covered the different roles data analysts play in business environments and the kinds of tasks that come with those roles. But data analysts have another important responsibility: making sure that their analyses are fair. Now, I know what you're probably thinking, data is based on collected facts, how can it be unfair? Well, that's a good question. Let's learn what fairness means when we talk about data analysis and why it's important for you as an analyst to keep in mind. Fairness means ensuring that your analysis doesn't create or reinforce bias. In other words, as a data analyst, you want to help create systems that are fair and inclusive to everyone. Sounds simple enough? Well, here's the tough part about fairness in data analytics. There isn't one standard definition of it, but hopefully the way we've just described it can give you one way to think about fairness for right now, but it's about to get a bit trickier. Sometimes conclusions based on data can be true and unfair. What can you do then? Well, let's find out with an example. Let's say we have a company that's kind of notorious for being a boys club. There isn't much representation of other genders. This company wants to see which employees are doing well, so they start gathering data on employee performance and their own company culture. The data shows that men are the only people succeeding at this company. Their conclusion? That they should hire more men. After all, they're doing really well here, right? But that's not a fair conclusion for a couple of reasons. First, it doesn't even consider all of the available data on company culture, so it paints an incomplete picture. Second, it doesn't think about the other surrounding factors that impact the data, or in other words, the conclusion doesn't consider the difficulties that people of different gender identities have trying to navigate a toxic work environment. If the company only looks at this conclusion, they won't acknowledge and address how harmful their culture is and they won't understand why certain people are set up to fail within it. That's why it's important to keep fairness in mind when analyzing data. The conclusion that only men are succeeding at this company is true, but it ignores other systematic factors that are contributing to this problem. But don't worry, there's a way to make a fair conclusion here. An ethical data analyst can look at the data gathered and conclude that the company culture is preventing some employees from succeeding, and the company needs to address those problems to boost performance. See how this conclusion paints a much more complete and fair picture. It recognizes the fact that some people aren't doing as well in this company and factors in why that could be instead of discriminating against a huge number of applicants in the future. As a data analyst it's your responsibility to make sure your analysis is fair and factors in the complicated social context that could create bias in your conclusions. It's important to think about fairness from the moment you start collecting data for a business task to the time you present your conclusions to your stakeholders. We'll learn more about bias in the data analysis process later on in another course. For now, let's check out an example of a data analysis that does a good job of considering fairness in its conclusion. A team of Harvard data scientists were developing a mobile platform to track patients at risk of cardiovascular disease in an area of the United States called the Stroke Belt. It's important to call out that there were a variety of reasons people living in this area might be more at risk. With that in mind, these data scientists recognized that fairness needed to be a priority for this project, so they built fairness into their models. The team took several fairness measures to make sure they were being as fair as possible when examining sensitive and potentially biased data. First, they teamed analysts with social scientists who could provide insights on human bias and the social context that created them. They also collected self reported data in a separate system to avoid the potential for racial bias, which might skew the results of their study and unfairly represent patients. To make sure this sample population was representative, they oversampled non-dominant groups to ensure the model was including them. It's clear that the team made fairness a top priority every step of the way. This helped them collect data and create conclusions that didn't negatively impact the communities they were studying. Hopefully these examples have given you a better idea of what fairness means in data analysis. But we're going to keep building on our understanding of fairness throughout this program and you'll get to practice with some activities.

To improve the effectiveness of its teaching staff, the administration of a high school offered the opportunity for all teachers to participate in a workshop. They were not required to attend; instead, the administration encouraged teachers to sign up. Of the 43 teachers on staff, 19 chose to take the workshop.

At the end of the academic year, the administration collected data on teacher performance for all teachers on staff. The data was collected via student survey. In the survey, students were asked to rank each teacher's effectiveness on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 6 (very good).

The administration compared data on teachers who attended the workshop to data on teachers who did not. The comparison revealed that teachers who attended the workshop had an average score of 4.95, while teachers who did not attend had an average score of 4.22. The administration concluded that the workshop was a success.

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Type your response in the text box below.

**1 / 1 point**

by analysing

**Correct**

Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! This is an example of unfair practice. It is tempting to conclude—as the administration did—that the workshop was a success. However, since the workshop was voluntary and not random, it is not appropriate to infer a causal relationship between attending the workshop and the higher rating.

The workshop might have been effective, but other explanations for the differences in the ratings cannot be ruled out. For example, another explanation could be that the staff volunteering for the workshop were the better, more motivated teachers. This group of teachers would be rated higher whether or not the workshop was effective.

It’s also notable that there is no direct connection between student survey responses and workshop attendance. The data analyst could correct this by asking for the teachers to be selected randomly to participate in the workshop. They could also collect data that measures something more directly related to workshop attendance, such as the success of a technique the teachers learned in that workshop.

An automotive company tests the driving capabilities of its self-driving car prototype. They carry out the tests on various types of roadways—specifically, a race track, trail track, and dirt road.

The researchers only test the prototype during the daytime. They collect two types of data: sensor data from the car during the drives and video data of the drives from cameras on the car.

They review the data after the initial tests. The results illustrate that the new self-driving car meets the performance standards across each of the roadways. As a result, the car can progress to the next phase of testing, which will include driving in various weather conditions.

**Correct**

Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! This case study shows an unfair practice. While the researchers test the prototype on three different tracks, they only conduct tests during the day.

Conditions on each track may be very different during the day and night and this could change the results significantly. The data analyst should correct this by asking the test team to add in nighttime testing to get a full perspective of how the prototype performs at any time of the day on the tracks.

An amusement park plans to add new rides to their property. First, they need to determine what kinds of new rides visitors want the park to build. In order to understand their visitors’ interests, the park develops a survey.

They decide to distribute the survey near the roller coasters because the lines are long enough that visitors will have time to answer all of the questions. After collecting this survey data, they find that most of the respondents want more roller coasters at the park. They conclude that they should add more roller coasters, as most of their visitors prefer them.

Consider this scenario:

- What are the examples of fair or unfair practices?
- How could a data analyst correct the unfair practices?

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Type your response in the text box below.

**1 / 1 point**

**Correct**

Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! This case study contains an unfair practice. While the decision to distribute surveys in places where visitors would have time to respond makes sense, it accidentally introduces sampling bias.

The only respondents to the survey are people waiting in line for the roller coasters. This may unfairly bias survey results, because respondents might prefer roller coasters. A data analyst could reduce sampling bias by distributing the survey at the entrance and exit of the amusement park. This would avoid targeting roller coaster fans and provide results from the park’s general audience.

# Alex: Fair and ethical data decisions

Hi, I'm Alex. I'm a research scientist at Google. My team is called the ethical AI team, we're a group of folks that really are concerned not only about how AI the technology operates, but how it interacts with society and how it might help or harm marginalized communities. When we talk about data ethics, we think about what is the good and right way of using data? What are going to be ways that uses of data are going to be beneficial to people? When it comes to data ethics, it's not just about minimizing harm but it's actually this concept of beneficence. How do we actually improve the lives of people by using data? When we think about data ethics we're thinking about, who's collecting the data? Why are they collecting it? How are they collecting it and for what purpose? Because of the way that organizations have imperatives to make money or to report to somebody or provide some analysis, we also have to keep strongly in mind how this is actually going to benefit people at the end of the day. Are the people represented in this data going to be benefited by this? I think that's the thing you never want to lose sight of as a data scientist or a data analyst. I think aspiring data analysts need to keep in mind that a lot of the data that you're going to encounter is data that comes from people so at the end of the day, data are people. You want to have a responsibility to those people that are represented in those data. Second, is thinking about how to keep aspects of their data protected and private. We don't want to go through our practice thinking about data instances as something we can just throw on the web. No, there needs to be considerations about how to keep that information, and likenesses like their images, or their voices, or their text. How do we keep that private? We also need to think about how we can have mechanisms of giving users and giving consumers more control over their data. It's not going to be sufficient just to say, we collect all this data and trust us with all these data. But we need to ensure that there's actionable ways in which people can consent to giving those data, and ways that they can ask for it to be revoked or removed. Data's growing and at the same time, we need to empower people to have control over their own data. The future is that data is always growing, we haven't seen any evidence that data is actually shrinking. With the knowledge that data's growing, these issues become more and more piqued, and more and more important to think about.

# Data analysts in different industries

By now, we know that there are all kinds of jobs in different industries available for data analysts. But now it's time to think about something just as important, how can you tell if a job is a good fit for you and your career goals? Tough one. Don't worry, that's exactly what we'll cover in this video. There's a lot of important factors to think about when searching for your dream job. Let's talk about some of the most common factors first, industry, tools, location, travel, and culture. Data is already being used by countless industries in all kinds of different ways, tech, marketing, finance, health care, the list goes on. But one thing that's important to keep in mind, every industry has specific data needs that have to be addressed differently by their data analysts. The same revenue data can be used in three different ways by data analysts in three different industries, financial services, Telecom, and tech. For example, a finance analyst at a bank post public revenue data of Telecom company X to create a forecast that predicts where revenues will be in the future to recommend the stock price. The business analyst at Telecom company X uses that same data to advise the sales team. Then a data analyst at the company who created a customer management tool for Telecom company X will use that revenue data to determine how efficiently the software is performing. Finance, telecom, and tech, all use data differently, so they need analysts who have different skills. It all comes down to what the needs of the industry are. Those needs will determine what task you'll be given, the questions you'll be answering and even how you'll approach job searching. If you're just starting out, a great way to guide your search is to think first about what you're interested in. Does helping people get healthier sound meaningful to you? Maybe you want to focus on using data to improve hospital admissions. What about helping people save for a happy retirement? You might want a job that uses data to determine risk factors in financial investments. Or maybe you're interested in helping journalism grow in your city. A job using data to help find your local news website find more subscribers could be the perfect role for you. The key is to think about your interests early in your job search. That'll lead you in the right direction, and it will help you in interviews too. Potential employers will want to know why you're interested in their company, and how you can address their needs, so if you can speak about your motivation to work in data analytics during interviews, you'll make yourself stand out in a great way. You'll have options when it comes to where you work and who you work for. But remember, you want to enjoy what you do, so it's a good idea to think about how you want to use your skills. Then search for jobs that allow you to do that. Next on the list of things to think about, location and travel. When you start your job search, you need to make some decisions about where you want to live, so it helps to ask yourself some questions, does your preferred industry have opportunities in your area? Are you trying to stay local or would you be happy relocating? How long are you willing to commute to work every day? Will you drive to work, walk, take public transport? Is that possible year-round? How do you feel about working remotely? Does working from home excite you or bore you? Of course, you'll want to consider cost of living, and whether or not you want the convenience of city living or a quiet suburban home, and it's not just about where you'll be based, some jobs may ask you to travel, which could be an exciting chance to see the world or a deal-breaker. It's all about what you want out of this job, so start asking yourself some of these questions. Figuring out the answers can help you narrow down your search even further, so you're only looking at jobs you'd actually accept. Once you've answered enough questions, you'll be able to identify some specific companies that fit your needs. At this point, it's a good time to think about your values and what company culture is a good fit for you. Ready, here comes some more questions, do you work best in a team or by yourself? Do you like to have a set routine or do you enjoy taking a new project and trying new things? Do your values match the company's values? You'll want to pay attention to these things during your job search and interview process, so you can be sure you fully invested in the company you work for. That's the best way to start building an exciting and fulfilling career. This program will help you learn the core skills for data analytics in any setting, it's up to you where you want to take them, whether that means starting in a completely new industry, or moving into an analyst position in an industry you already have experience in. Hopefully what we've covered here has helped you get on track for your future job search. After this, you have a few activities to do, and then you'll be able to move on to the next part of this course. We learned a lot so far, like what opportunities are out there for data analysts in different industries. How data analysts help businesses make better decisions. The importance of fairness and data analytics, and the potential questions you can start asking yourself before your future job search, and you can always look back at these lessons if you want to review. In an upcoming course, we'll look at the skills all successful data analysts have and you'll learn how you can start practicing them too.

## **Decoding the job description**

The data analyst role is one of many job titles that contain the word “analyst.”

To name a few others that sound similar but may not be the same role:

- Business analyst — analyzes data to help businesses improve processes, products, or services
- Data analytics consultant — analyzes the systems and models for using data
- Data engineer — prepares and integrates data from different sources for analytical use
- Data scientist — uses expert skills in technology and social science to find trends through data analysis
- Data specialist — organizes or converts data for use in databases or software systems
- Operations analyst — analyzes data to assess the performance of business operations and workflows

Data analysts, data scientists, and data specialists sound very similar but focus on different tasks. As you start to browse job listings online, you might notice that companies’ job descriptions seem to combine these roles or look for candidates who may have overlapping skills. The fact that companies often blur the lines between them means that you should take special care when reading the job descriptions and the skills required.

The table below illustrates some of the overlap and distinctions between them:

Title: Decoding the job description

data analysts:
-problem solving: Use existing tools and methods to solve problems with existing types of data
-analysis: Analyze collected data to help stakeholders make better decisions
-other relevant skills: database queries, data visualization, dashboards, reports and spreadsheets

data scientists:
-problem solving: Invent new tools and models, ask open-ended questions, 
and collect new types 
of data 
-analysis: Analyze and interpret complex data to make business predictions
-other relevant skills: advanced statistics, machine learning, deep learning, data optimization, and programming

data specialists:
-problem solving: Use in-depth knowledge of databases as a tool to solve problems and manage data
-analysis: Organize large volumes of data for use in data analytics or business operations
-other relevant skills: data manipulation, information security, data models, scalability of data, and disaster recovery

We used the role of data specialist as one example of many specializations within data analytics, but you don’t have to become a data specialist! Specializations can take a number of different turns. For example, you could specialize in developing data visualizations and likewise go very deep into that area.

## **Job specializations by industry**

We learned that the data specialist role concentrates on in-depth knowledge of databases. In similar fashion, other specialist roles for data analysts can focus on in-depth knowledge of specific industries. For example, in a job as a business analyst you might wear some different hats than in a more general position as a data analyst. As a business analyst, you would likely collaborate with managers, share your data findings, and maybe explain how a small change in the company’s project management system could save the company 3% each quarter. Although you would still be working with data all the time, you would focus on using the data to improve business operations, efficiencies, or the bottom line.

Other industry-specific specialist positions that you might come across in your data analyst job search include:

- Marketing analyst — analyzes market conditions to assess the potential sales of products and services
- HR/payroll analyst — analyzes payroll data for inefficiencies and errors
- Financial analyst — analyzes financial status by collecting, monitoring, and reviewing data
- Risk analyst — analyzes financial documents, economic conditions, and client data to help companies determine the level of risk involved in making a particular business decision
- Healthcare analyst — analyzes medical data to improve the business aspect of hospitals and medical facilities

Explore data analyst job descriptions and industry-specific analyst roles. You will start to get a better sense of the different data analyst jobs out there and which types of roles you’re most interested to go after.

# Samah: Interview best practices

My name is Samah Moid, and I'm a recruiter here at Google for the large customer sales team. Basically, I hire talent for the sales team here. Even within the sales recruiting space, I recruit specifically for the analytical lead roles here at Google. I want the candidate to be as comfortable as possible. As a recruiter I'm also their advocate. If they're a good fit for the team, I'd like to present them in the best light. As a recruiter some advice I would give for a data analyst that's starting to look for a job. Think about a time where you've used data to solve a problem, whether it's in your professional or personal projects. Another tip, I would say for a data analyst that's looking for a new job is to increase your professional network. There are many ways to increase your professional network. One of them is to increase your online footprint, reach out to other analysts on LinkedIn, join local meet-ups with other data scientists. Sometimes when we're looking for a unique skill set, recruiters are going on websites like LinkedIn, and GitHub, and trying to find that talent themselves. It's really important to have your LinkedIn updated along with websites like GitHub, where you can showcase a lot of the data analysts projects you've done. Another tip I would say for an in-person interview is to prepare questions for the interviewer. Make sure they're not broad questions. They should be questions that will help you understand the team and the job better. If you're given a case study in an interview, you should expect to be given a business problem along with the sample data set. Then you'd be asked to take that sample data set, analyze it, and come up with a solution. One of the things you can do to help prepare yourself for this is to ensure you are analyzing the data and coming up with a solution that relates back to that data. Sometimes there is no right answer, and a lot of times interviewers are looking to see your thought process and the way you get to your solution. I highly encourage that if you find a role that you're interested in, not only apply to it, but go the next step. Look for the recruiter. Look for the hiring manager online. See if you can reach out to them and set up a coffee chat or send them your resume directly. Online applications could be a really big black hole where you never hear back from the recruiter or the team. When you reach out directly to a hiring manager or recruiter, it really shows your eagerness for the role and your interests for the role. Even if sometimes you don't get a response from reaching out, you never know, you try multiple different times. That one time you get a response back from a recruiter or hiring manager, could be the time you get the job that you really wanted.
